Code for manuscript "Multiple evolutionary pressures shape identical consonant avoidance in the world’s languages"

Models were run on the University of Zurich's Science Cluster using the Slurm workload management system and the Rstan anaconda environment (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-rstan).

The following shell script runs all data processing and model fitting scripts:

```
./process_all_data.sh
