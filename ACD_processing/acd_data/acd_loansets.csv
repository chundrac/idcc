The reconstruction of this variant, and &ast;_q_-final forms of the first person plural inclusive and exclusive oblique pronouns, is based on material provided by Jason Lobel.  The reconstruction of all forms of the oblique personal pronouns has benefited from unpublished data provided by Lobel, although they are independently reconstructible without this material."

30090,acquired: cloth acquired in trade from Chinese (?),,Loan,"Presumably a loan from southern Chinese, although a plausible source word is yet to be identified. Thanks to Yen-ling Chen for tracing the history of this form, and drawing my attention to the suggestion that the name may derive from a reduplicated form of __language__Malay__ _kain_ ‘cloth’: _kain-kain_ > _kankan_ > _kaŋkan_ > _kaŋgan_."

29607,ailment: eye ailment,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Tagalog__.
29516,"alcohol, distilled liquor",*arak,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Arabic__. Dempwolff treated this form as native, but [Jones (1978)](Source#cldf:jones1978) regards it as a borrowing of __language__Arabic__ _ʔaraq_ 'strong drink'. This interpretation is supported by the initial consonant of __language__Wolio__ _ʔara_ 'arrack, brandy (made from sago juice, or the nectar of nipah-palm blossom)', and by numerous irregularities in the sound correspondences, although the appearance of forms of the word in __language__Old Javanese__ and __language__Malagasy__ is in need of further study. Such __language__Philippine__ languages as __language__Casiguran Dumagat__, __language__Kapampangan__, __language__Hanunóo__, and __language__Aklanon__ appear to have acquired the word through __language__TAGA__, but __language__Ilokano__ and __language__Bikol__ evidently acquired it directly from speakers of __language__Malay__. Throughout much of eastern Indonesia the word appears to have been borrowed through the mediation of __language__Malay__, and the same may be true of __language__Chamorro__ _arak_, although __language__Ilokano__ _árak_ is another plausible source.



This term is defined more by the process of distillation, which marks it off from native forms of brewing liquors by simple fermentation, than by any distinctive ingredient. Its wide distribution and integration into the morphological system of some languages shows how easily loanwords can take on the characteristics of native forms. Somewhat ironically, __language__Old Javanese__ _arak_ must have been borrowed during the earliest period of Islamization, as it is one of the few __language__Arabic__ loans in the __language__Old Javanese__ material."

30436,alms,,Loan,Borrowing of Spanish _limosna_ ‘alms’.
30579,"alright, go ahead!",,Loan,Apparently a borrowing of Spanish _darle_/_dale_ ‘go ahead!’.
30530,"although, even if",,Loan,"Philippine forms are from Spanish _mas que_ ‘although, even so’, and the __language__Malay__ form is evidently from the similar expression in Portuguese.

30168,alum,*tawas 'alum',Loan,Probably a __language__Malay__ loan distribution.  [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) proposed __language__PAn__ &ast;_tawas_ 'alum'.
29517,ambergris,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Arabic__."

29519,animal,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. No general term for 'animal' has been reconstructed for any early __language__AN__ proto-language, and the __language__Malay__ term _binataŋ_ was thus free to fill a gap in the semantic systems of many languages in Indonesia and the southern Philippines. As is often the case with terms for 'animal' in natural languages, this word functioned both as a category marker and as a term of abuse."

The plant evidently was introduced by the Spanish into the central Philippines, and probably into Guam during the same period.

To date a similar form has not been found in any other Formosan language, and although this forms clearly shows greater similarity than can be expected from chance the conditions under which borrowing might have taken place remain obscure."
30200,artificial cockspur,*tazi ‘artificial cockspur’,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. The direction of borrowing for this term strongly suggests that cockfighting was introduced into the Austronesian world in western Indonesia, and from there spread northward into the Philippines and eastward to Sulawesi.

The history of this word remains somewhat unclear.  [Merrill (1954:153)](Source#cldf:merrill1954) notes that the jackfruit “although now widely distributed in the archipelago and frequently planted, was an early introduction from tropical Asia.”  By ‘tropical Asia’ he presumably means India, although no further information is given.  Since the word occurs in __language__Old Javanese__ and has spread into a number of Philippine languages, it is likely that its introduction into the Austronesian family goes back at least a millennium.  Its appearance in __language__Chamorro__ presumably is due to contact with Philippine languages such as __language__Tagalog__ during the centuries of Spanish occupation of the Marianas."

Since the __language__Malay__ word itself in the latter comparison is a borrowing of Sanskrit _ayuta_ ‘ten thousand’, it is possible that the Sanskrit form was borrowed directly into Philippine languages rather than through the medium of __language__Malay__, but historical records suggest otherwise.  If we side with the historical records, and assume that Sanskrit loans in Philipppine languages were invariably mediated through __language__Malay__, we must conclude that this word underwent a first loanword adaptation in which /_y_/ was replaced by /_j_/, and then a second loanword adaptation in which this change was reversed.

30309,betel nut,,Loan,"The history of this word is puzzling.  _A priori_ it appears to be a straightforward comparison pointing to __language__PAn__ &ast;_pineŋ_ ‘areca nut’, but since better candidates are available for this meaning a reconstruction is immediately suspect.  The gloss of the __language__Pazeh__ form explicitly indicates it as a loanword from Minnan Chinese, and since the __language__Malay__ word appears to be native this raises a question about the direction of borrowing.  The use of betel is not common to Chinese culture as a whole, but is widespread in the Austronesian world, and for this reason it is likely that __language__Malay__ _pinaŋ_ was borrowed by Hokkien speakers, and transported to Taiwan.  There, for reasons that remain obscure, it replaced the native word for this referent (possibly a reflex of __language__PAn__ &ast;_Sawiki_, which is reflected in several divergent Formosan languages)."

30064,Bitter orange Seville orange: Citrus aurantium,,Loan,"From Spanish _cajel_ ‘Bitter orange, Seville orange (also called ‘blood orange’), a native of the Mediterranean region that must have been imported into the Philippines directly from Spain, rather than through the usual Mexican route for plants introduced during the Spanish colonial period."

30537,blanket,,Loan,Borrowing of Spanish _manta_ ‘blanket’.
29545,bleat,,Loan,"Borrowed, or a convergent product of onomatopoeia associated with a borrowed animal. Sheep and goats probably were introduced into the Austronesian world during the Indianization of Southeast Asia. From a point or points of entry in western Indonesia they must have spread northward into the Philippines and eastward into the Lesser Sundas. [Fox, J. (1977:43)](bib-Fox) notes that on Roti and Savu in the Lesser Sundas ""Goats are considered the 'real' or 'native' animal ... and sheep have been assimilated to this category."" This may indicate different times of introduction into island Southeast Asia for the two animals, or different rates of diffusion from a common place and time of initial introduction."

The __language__Tagalog__ form can be more convincingly compared with __language__Malay__ _kəmbaŋ_ ‘expansion; blossoming out; (Java) flower’, __language__Old Javanese__ _kəmbaŋ_, _kambaŋ_ ‘flower’, məmbaŋ ‘to open, of a flower’, __language__Javanese__ _kembaŋ_ ‘flower, blossom’, where it seems clearly to be a loanword.  __language__Ngaju Dayak__ _kambaŋ_ is almost certainly a __language__Javanese__ loan."
29547,blue,*biru,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. Under this interpretation the _d_ of __language__Mongondow__ _mo-bidu_ presents difficulties, since it would normally be assumed that where variants in _d_, _r_ appear the _d_ variant is historically primary. However, neither __language__Iban__ _biru_ nor __language__Malay__ _biru_ can regularly reflect &ast;_bidu_, and for the present it is perhaps best to assume that __language__Mongondow__ _mo-bidu_ is a result of analogical back-formation from a loanword with _r_. For instances of hypercorrection involving _r_ and _y_ in the history of __language__Mongondow__ see [Blust (1982)](Source#cldf:blust1982)."

29552,body,*badan,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Arabic__ through __language__Malay__.
29945,"bolo, machete",,Loan,Probably a __language__Tagalog__ loan.  Any word which implies metallurgy (as opposed to simple knowledge of iron ore) is almost certainly post-__language__Proto-Philippines__.
29962,"bolo: sword, kris, bolo",,Loan,"Since this reconstruction implies the use of metallurgy, the comparison almost certainly is a product of borrowing from __language__Malay__. It is noteworthy, however, that in areas that developed metallurgy relatively early, as Borneo, this word does not appear, suggesting that it skipped areas in which native smiths were already producing iron tools, and spread from Malay into the Philippines prior to the advent of metallurgy in that archipelago."

30689,breadfruit,,Loan,"This etymology is very odd.  Neither __language__Tagalog__ nor __language__Cebuano__ has _r-_ in native forms, yet both have it in this word, and if it is a loan the source is unclear.  Moreover, _rímas_ is in competition with &ast;_kamansi(q)_, &ast;_kulu_, and &ast;_qatipulu_, all of which refer to types of breadfruit in Philippine languages.  One possibility is that there were names for several types of both seeded and seedless breadfruit, and that one of these was &ast;_rímas_, which was borrowed into __language__Tagalog__ and __language__Cebuano__ after &ast;_r_ had already become /_l_/ in those languages.  The __language__Aklanon__ form looks like a hypercorrection, but this would only be possible for speakers who realized that most Spanish names of introduced plants were borrowed in their plural forms (as _bayabas_ < Spanish _guayaba_)."

30106,"buffalo: water buffalo, carabao",,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, ultimately from a Mon-Khmer source ([Thurgood 1999:322](Source#cldf:thurgood1999)).  __language__Kavalan__ has several loanwords from Philippine languages and from Spanish that date to the brief Spanish occupation of the Ilan basin from 1626-1642, during which time they came up from Manila in an attempt to expand their colonial holdings.  The source of __language__Fijian__ _karavau_ remains unclear.  [Capell (1968:85)](Source#cldf:capell1968) entertains two speculations: 1. “the name came from Vuda, where the people, seeing reddish cattle, called them after the cloth _karavau_”, 2. “probably Eng. _caribou_”.  The second of these appears particularly improbable."
30667,Buginese,,Loan,"Borrowing, either from __language__Malay__ or from __language__Buginese__ itself, although the negative characterizations of Buginese temperament in __language__Ngaju Dayak__ and __language__Kambera__ must be creations in those languages. This item serves to demonstrate the extent to which the Buginese sailors of southern Sulawesi were known for centuries as a result of their trade and other contacts throughout the coastal areas of much of central and eastern Indonesia."
29557,bulge out,,Loan,"This item appears to be a __language__GCPh__ innovation which has been borrowed from __language__Tagalog__ into __language__Kapampangan__, __language__Pangasinan__ and __language__Ilokano__. The similarity of these forms to __language__Malagasy__ _vónto_, _vóntona_ and __language__Javanese__ _butun_ which led Dempwolff to include them in a single cognate set is attributed to chance."

29739,cake: rice cake,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Tamil__. The forms in __language__Maranao__ and __language__Tiruray__ suggest borrowing through an intermediate language in which final _-m_ became a velar nasal.

30133,"casket, coffin",,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Tagalog__.
29562,cassava manioc,,Loan,"Borrowing from Malay.  Cassava presumably was introduced to Southeast Asia by the Portuguese, as it is indigenous to the Amazonian region.  Why the Malay name suggests a derivation from Bengal remains unclear. The manioc is an Amazonian plant, and presumably was brought to Asia by the Portuguese. The present comparison suggests that it first reached India, then Malaya before Malay merchants introduced it into the southern Philippines."
30148,cassowary,,Loan,"A much longer, but geographically more restricted version of this comparison was proposed by [Clark (2011:288)](Source#cldf:clark2011), who --- following earlier work by [Milke (1965)](Source#cldf:milke1965) posited __language__PCEMP__ &ast;_kasawari_ ‘cassowary’, __language__POc__ &ast;_kasuari_ ‘dwarf cassowary’.  However, the history of this term is unclear.  Austronesian speakers would not have encountered the cassowary until they reached New Guinea and the Bismarck archipelago, yet reflexes of this form are found far to the west of the Wallace Line, suggesting a later spread of the word through trade.  Even the Oceanic forms that Clark has assembled as support for his reconstruction are wildly irregular, suggesting an equally complex history of borrowing."

30310,"cat, Felis domesticus",,Loan,"It is unclear when domestic cats first reached insular Southeast Asia, and it is possible that this word originally referred to a native animal.

This is an extremely messy comparison that appears to have resulted mostly by borrowing one or the other variants in __language__Malay__, although the reasoning for the doubleting in __language__Malay__ itself remains unclear."
29571,checkered: cloth with checkered pattern,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
30547,checkers,,Loan,"From American Spanish _dama_ ‘game of draughts, game of checkers’."

29567,Chinese,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
29568,Chinese,,Loan,"This is almost certainly a loan distribution, but if so it is puzzling that __language__Malay__ (the only western __language__Indonesian__ language which has a form with first-syllable //_i_//) apparently does not use the term to mean 'Chinese', and __language__Javanese__, which uses the term to mean 'Chinese', has only a form with first-syllable shwa."
30043,chisel,,Loan,"Also __language__Ibaloy__ _sinsil_ ‘chisel’.  From Spanish cincel ‘chisel (for stone and metal)’, with assimilation to the pattern of a reduplicated monosyllable."
29864,cicada,,Loan,"This is a problematic comparison, since the only regular source of __language__Pazeh__ _l_ is &ast;_N_, __language__Thao__ _l_ is found only in __language__Bunun__ loanwords, where it can reflect &ast;_l_ or &ast;_R_, and the only regular sources of __language__Kavalan__ _r_ are &ast;_l_, and less commonly, &ast;_R_ ([Li and Tsuchida 2006](Source#cldf:liandtsuchida2006)).  If we were to attempt a reconstruction the most likely shape would be &ast;_lalay_, which shows a regular development in __language__Kavalan__ _raray_, but irregularities in the other two languages, where we would also expect forms with _r_ rather than _l_.  There seems to be little alternative except to assume borrowing.  However, this is also problematic, since 1. the cicada is ubiquitous in Taiwan, its whining sound being omnipresent during the summer months wherever there is vegetation, and 2. __language__Kavalan__ is not presently in contact with either of the other languages, and probably never has been."
30421,citrus fruit,*limaw ‘citrus’,Loan,"Almost certainly a borrowing of Portuguese _limão_ ‘citrus fruit’.

However, the __language__Tagalog__ word does not appear to be related to the others, and the remaining forms do not justify a reconstruction. (_see_ ‘use, wear, dress up in finery’)"
29572,"clotted, coagulated",,Loan,"__language__Bintulu__, __language__Ngaju Dayak__  and __language__Karo Batak__ are assumed to be loans from __language__Malay__. The similarity of these __language__WMP__ forms to those in __language__CMP__ and __language__OC__ languages is attributed to chance."
29573,"clove, mace",,Loan,"Borrowing. The distribution of this item is consistent with the hypothesis, first suggested to me by James T. Collins, that the pre-European spice trade of Indonesia was mediated by Brunei Malays in a commercial arc that linked Brunei (and peninsular Malay ports) with the southern Philippines and northern Moluccas. The maintenance of such contacts on a regular basis would have required sailing along the western and northern coasts of Sabah, through the Sulu Archipelago to southern Mindanao, and from there to Sangir-Talaud and northern Sulawesi before reaching the northern Moluccas. Given this interpretation the otherwise puzzling occurrence of apparent Philippine loanwords in Buli of southern Halmahera can be placed within a coherent historical context. There can be little doubt that the same network served the propagation of Islam. 



Although some form of spice trade between eastern and western Indonesia (and points beyond) probably predated the arrival of Islam in island Southeast Asia by many centuries, there is little evidence for large-scale trade contacts with eastern Indonesia during the Indianization of western Indonesia (e.g. the Sriwijaya period). On present evidence, then, it appears most likely that a regular and systematic linkage of Moluccan clove and nutmeg suppliers with Bruneian or other Malay distributors developed in concert with the diffusion of Islam into Borneo, the southern Philippines and the northern Moluccas during the 14th and 15th centuries. If so, the Brunei of Pigafetta, with its lavish displays of wealth and rank, must have been a relatively nouveau-riche Islamic elaboration upon an older Indianized state in which the supporting trade base had only recently undergone a fundamental shift from a western Indonesian to an eastern Indonesian emphasis."
30714,"cock, rooster; male bird or chicken",,Loan,"Probably a __language__Bunun__ loan in __language__Thao__, although the _z_ : _l_ correspondence is unexpected ([Blust 1996](Source#cldf:blust1996))."
29853,cockroach,,Loan,"Two considerations make it likely that this is a loan distribution.  First, __language__PAn__ &ast;_Sipes_ can be reconstructed in the same meaning.

[Merrill (1954:228)](Source#cldf:merrill1954) attributes this to borrowing from an unidentified Chinese source.  Although a precise donor language is difficult to identify, a Chinese source appears likely from information that I have received courtesy of Yen-ling Chen, who notes that “Convolvulus (_Ipomoea aquatica_)... in written Chinese can be 空心菜, 蕹菜 or 通菜 (Mandarin: _khong ɕin tshai_ (空心菜), _ioŋ tshai_ (蕹菜), _thoŋ tshai_ (通菜).”  To this she adds that “‘a hole’ in (Taiwanese) Southern Min is _khang_ (孔), and the same character in contemporary Mandarin is pronounced as _khong_.

29600,duck,*bibi,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. The history of domesticated ducks in island Southeast Asia is still poorly understood. Although a term for 'wild duck' (&ast;_ŋaRaq_) was present in __language__PMP__, there is no non-suspect linguistic evidence for early domestication of ducks by __language__AN__-speaking peoples. The presence of a mid-front vowel in many of the terms cited here points to borrowing from __language__Malay__. At the same time the occurrence of reflexes in __language__Malagasy__ and __language__Old Javanese__  indicates that diffusion of the term (and the associated practice of domesticating ducks) must have begun by the 7th century A.D. All of this is consistent with a hypothesis that the practice of domesticating ducks was introduced to island Southeast Asia during the Indianization of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. 


This is one of the few cases in which a __language__Malay__ loanword appears to have reached Taiwan, but given the practical value of the animal and the likelihood that diffusion to Taiwan took place directly from the Philippines a hypothesis of borrowing is not at all unlikely. Although a __language__Sanskrit__ term for 'goose' was borrowed by __language__Malay__, _bébék_ appears to be an onomatopoetic formation from native lexical material. __language__Gedaged__ _bibi_ 'turkey', __language__Tongan__ _pīpī_ 'turkey' and similar terms in other __language__OC__ languages seem clearly to be the product of an independent development."

Third, although __language__Malay__ loanwords are common in many Philippine languages, this word is not reported in Standard Malay ([Wilkinson 1959](Source#cldf:wilkinson1959)).

29621,"gem, jewel",,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Sanskrit__."
29622,"ghoul, vampire",,Loan,"The essential content of this morpheme is a reference to women who have died in childbirth, and to the culturally perceived vindictiveness and malevolence that their ghosts feel, especially toward men. In Java it is said that the _puntianak_ appears as a beautiful young woman in the twilight of the evening and tempts gullible men to follow her from the village. Once they are alone she turns and flees with a hideous shriek, revealing a hole through the middle of her back, her feet not quite touching the earth. 



The forms cited here are conspicuous for their multiple phonological irregularities and apparent morphological reanalyses. This strongly suggests that the form has been borrowed, probably from __language__Malay__. According to Alton L. Becker (p.c.) a similar folk belief is found in Burma. If true it is tempting to hypothesize that the _puntianak_ belief was ultimately borrowed by speakers of an early form of __language__Malay__ from a mainland Southeast Asian source and subsequently disseminated through much of island Southeast Asia.



The problem with this hypothesis is that a similar belief is found among speakers of __language__OC__ languages. For __language__Nggela__ in the central Solomons [Fox, C. (1955)](Source#cldf:fox1955) cites _vahuhu_ 'be born, give birth to', _mate_ 'dead, death; kill, etc.', and _vahuhumate_ '1. goblins that sing when the moon goes down. They have holes in their heads and backs, 2. die in childbirth'. What we have then, appears to be a belief that was present in __language__PMP__ society, perhaps under the name &ast;_m-atay anak_ (cf. &ast;_aCay_). For reasons that are unclear, the __language__Malay__ or __language__Javanese__ name of this belief was widely borrowed during a much more recent period of history, overlaying an older cultural distribution and presumably replacing the older name in most areas."

30024,gnat,,Loan,
29948,"go ahead!, O.K.!",,Loan,From Spanish _sigue_.
29624,goat,,Loan,"Borrowing. The phonology of this form (with its mid-front vowel and prenasalized initial consonant in several languages) unmistakably indicates a lexical distribution resulting from diffusion. However, unlike most widespread loan distributions in island Southeast Asia it is difficult to attribute this one to borrowing from either __language__Malay__ or __language__Javanese__. The terms in eastern Indonesia almost certainly were borrowed from some language of Sulawesi, most likely __language__Buginese__ or __language__Makassarese__. The origin of the term in the languages of Sulawesi, however, remains unclear. The forms in __language__Minangkabau__ and __language__Malay__ suggest that this word, like the similar term for 'duck', is onomatopoetic. An independent term for 'goat' (&ast;_kandiŋ_) is found in a number of the languages of Borneo and the Philippines, but the domestication of goats is certainly of secondary origin in island Southeast Asia. Perhaps, like the domestication of ducks, it was introduced during the Indianization of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula by the 7th century A.D."
30050,goat,,Loan,"The history of goats in insular Southeast Asia remains to be worked out in detail, but the evidence currently available suggests that they were introduced from South Asia around the beginning of the Christian era ([Blust 2002:104-105](Source#cldf:blust2002)).  What makes this loanword particularly odd is that doublets &ast;_kambiŋ_ and &ast;_kandiŋ_ are both widely distributed in insular Southeast Asia, and only the first of these variants can plausibly be attributed to borrowing from __language__Malay__."
29625,gold,,Loan,"A very widespread loanword which [Wilkinson (1959)](Source#cldf:wilkinson1959) traces to __language__Sanskrit__ _mashaka_ 'mace', and thence to 'gold', since the latter was measured by the mace. Whatever its origin, it seems clear that the known distribution of this term is largely a product of borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Lee (1966)](bib-Lee) reconstructs __language__Proto-Chamic__ &ast;_ʔama-h_ 'gold', and [Mills (1975)](Source#cldf:mills1975) reconstructs __language__Proto-South Sulawesi__ &ast;_immas_ 'gold', but in at least the latter case, and probably in both, the word almost certainly was borrowed from __language__Malay__ after the proto-language in question had already divided into daughter languages. The glosses of __language__Bikol__ _amás_ and of such South Sulawesi forms as __language__Tae'__ _ammaʔ_ and __language__Buginese__ _emmeʔ_ suggest that the early __language__Malay__ prototype referred to a unit of measure for gold, probably developed after the initiation of Indian contact in the early centuries of the Christian era.

It is assumed that __language__PMC__ was spoken in southwest Borneo, and that populations speaking __language__PMC__ dialects began to expand into eastern Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula and coastal regions of the Gulf of Thailand as far north as the central portions of modern Vietnam in the first or second century B.C. It is noteworthy that at least two of the indigenous languages of Borneo have doublets, one reflecting an earlier, and the other a later loan, thus supporting Borneo as the geographical locus of this innovated lexical item. 


As noted by [Bellwood (1985:xyz)](bib-Bellwood) the expansion of __language__Austronesian__ speakers into mainland Southeast Asia may be correlated with archaeological evidence of innovations in ironworking technology which were taking place in southwest Borneo in the centuries immediately preceding the beginning of Indian contact. Although a word for 'iron' (&ast;_bariS_) may be much older in __language__Austronesian__ ([Blust 1976](Source#cldf:blust1976)), the older term could well have referred to unprocessed iron ore which had no utilitarian function.

Given the importance of the Manila Galleon trade, which connected Manila and Acapulco by annual voyages from 1572 to 1815, the introduction of this plant and its name almost certainly took place through __language__Tagalog__, with subsequent borrowing into other Philippine languages from the region of Manila Bay. It is noteworthy that it evidently was not introduced into Guam despite this island being a regular stopover in the Galleon trade.

29942,"miscellaneous: various, miscellaneous",,Loan,"Also __language__Hanunóo__ _sadisádi_ ‘miscellany; multifarious, various’.  The history of this form is puzzling.  Although it may have begun with the general meaning ‘various, miscellaneous’, in many languages it probably is a __language__Tagalog__ loan that became widespread after the Spanish colonization and the introduction of a money economy.  In any case, an assignment to __language__Proto-Philippines__ would be incautious without further evidence of forms that are not likely to be borrowed."

29681,money,,Loan,"Almost certainly a borrowing of Southern __language__Minangkabau__ _wan_, probably early in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). According to Robert Cheng (p.c.) some __language__Minangkabau__ dialects, such as that of __language__Swatow__, permit only the velar nasal in final position. The final velar in _uaŋ_ may thus have been present in the lending language. The pronunciation _uaŋ_ is, of course, an accomodation to the predominant disyllabic canonical shape of most __language__Austronesian__ languages, although a canonically atypical variant _waŋ_ persists here and there. With the advent of Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia and English colonial rule in Malaysia the meaning of _uaŋ_, evidently began to shift from a specific unit of currency (which presumably was no longer used) to the more general sense which it has in most languages today."
29682,monkey sp.,,Loan,"Borrowing. The route of transmission of this form remains unclear. There is every reason to believe that Bornean forms such as __language__Kelabit__ _bedhuk_, __language__Berawan (Long Terawan)__ _becuʔ_, __language__Bintulu__ _bəɗuk_, __language__Melanau (Mukah)__ _beduk_ and __language__Kayan__ _beruk_ are native, and reflect a prototype of the shape &ast;_beduk_. It is, moreover, likely that __language__Malay__ originated from a population movement out of southwest Borneo beginning in the first or second century BC ([Blust 1994](Source#cldf:blust1994)). Early __language__Malayic__ speakers in Borneo evidently borrowed this word from a language in which &ast;_-d-_ > _r_ (as __language__Kayan__). The form is reflected with this irrgularity in __language__Iban__ (a continuation of the Malayic population that remained in Borneo) in __language__Malay__, in __language__Lampung__ of southern Sumatra, and in __language__Balinese__ (which exhibits a second irregularity). The simplest hypothesis appears to be that speakers of __language__Malay__ introduced a native Bornean monkey, and with it an irregularly altered form of its name, to Sumatra and perhaps some other parts of western Indonesia."

However, the __language__Fijian__ word is phonologically irregular, and best treated as a chance resemblance.  More generally, since iron nails were unknown in the Austronesian world before Western contact, the referent of this terms would have been a wooden dowel or peg, and __language__PAn__ &ast;_pasek_ offers a far less problematic proto-form for this meaning."

[Zoetmulder (1982)](Source#cldf:zoetmulder1982) gives a similar etymology for __language__Old Javanese__ _palaŋka_, _palyanka_, _paryanka_. If the original meaning was 'palanquin' and all of the items included here are related, it is remarkable how semantically divergent the reflexes of this form have become. Moreover, if it is a loan it is striking how culturally integrated the __language__Ngaju Dayak__ word appears to be. __language__Karo Batak__ _pelaŋkah_ 'feeding trough for pigs; trough in which gambier is crushed by trampling; coffin carved from a tree trunk', __language__Toba Batak__ _palaŋka_ 'wooden trough' are best treated as chance resemblances."

29703,papaya,*betik,Loan,"Borrowing. The papaya is not native to Southeast Asia, but was introduced from the New World during the Age of Exploration (source: ). [Wilkinson (1959)](Source#cldf:wilkinson1959) suggests a derivation from the __language__Arabic__ word for 'watermelon', borrowed into Portuguese as _pateca_, and then applied to the papaya. __language__Minangkabau__ _buah ketéla_ ('Castilian fruit') suggests a __language__Spanish__ introduction, a not unlikely possibility given the clearly __language__Spanish__ origin of the word in most _Philippine_ languages (_papayas_, _kapayas_, etc.)."

Moreover, [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) included __language__Fijian__ _covu-ta_ ‘to break or cut food small; to peck at’, which appears to be unrelated.

30454,pomegranate: Punica granatum L.,,Loan,"Also __language__Maranao__ _dalimaɁ_ ‘pomegranate: _Punica granatum_ L.’.

[Zoetmulder (1982)](Source#cldf:zoetmulder1982) gives __language__Old Javanese__ _dalima_, _dālima_ as a borrowing of Sanskrit _dāḍima_ ‘pomegranate’, and [Wilkinson (1959)](Source#cldf:wilkinson1959) attributes __language__Malay__ _dəlima_ to the same source.  It therefore seems likely that this fruit was introduced during the Indianization of Sumatra, Java and the Malay peninsula.  From there it presumably would have spread through Malay trade contacts both to the Moluccas, where a Malay presence in connection with the spice trade began by at least the 7th century AD, and to the Philippines, where Malay-speaking Islamic missionaries had begun to penetrate shortly before the arrival of the Spanish."

29719,"power, venom",,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Sanskrit__. This comparison is remarkable for at least two reasons: 1) although it seems clearly to be a __language__Sanskrit__ loan which acquired much of its attested distribution as a result of borrowing from __language__Malay__, it originally referred to animal (particularly snake) venom, a referent for which a native term would normally be expected, 2) the word is very widespread in the Philippines and both western and eastern Indonesia, and has acquired a variety of secondary meanings including that of general force or power, skill, knowledge and ability. In __language__Malay__ and some other languages (e.g. __language__Rembong__) this abstraction and generalization of the original concrete nominal sense has gone even further, leading to the use of _bisa_ as an auxiliary verb meaning 'can, be able'."

29744,sacrifice,,Loan,"Borrowing. Although an Indian source has not been identified, the semantics suggest that this item was acquired either by direct lexical borrowing or by lexical innovation in response to novel cultural influences during the Indianization of western Indonesia.

30124,sand,"*kesik ‘coarse sand, gravel’",Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) proposed &ast;_kesik_ ‘coarse sand, gravel’."
30255,sandal,,Loan,"Although the __language__Maranao__ and __language__Malay__ forms show regular sound correspondences that apparently point to &ast;_talumpaq_, footwear was unknown among Austronesian-speaking peoples prior to modern times.  The further irregular of the medial liquid points further to a still unclear history of borrowing. Almost certainly a Philippine loanword in __language__Buruese__, perhaps via contact with the Sama Bajaw."

30438,"sandpaper: scale, balance for weighing things",,Loan,Borrowing from Chinese.
30504,"saw, tool for sawing",,Loan,"Borrowing of __language__Malay__ _gərgaji_ ‘a saw; to saw’, ultimately from Sanskrit _krakaca_."
30153,"sawdust, wood shavings",,Loan,"[Mintz and Britannico (1985)](Source#cldf:mintzanddelrosariobritanico1985) derive the __language__Bikol__ form from a Hokkien original, and [English (1986)](Source#cldf:english1986) holds a similar view of the __language__Tagalog__ form, although this has not been confirmed."
30751,scaly anteater,,Loan,"Almost certainly a __language__Malay__ loan distribution.  Although the pangolin, or scaly anteater, is native to Palawan, reflexes of __language__PAn__ &ast;_qaRem_ ‘pangolin, scaly anteater’ are found further south in many of the languages of Borneo, and imply that __language__Palawano__ _teŋgiliŋ_ is an innovation.  Since a subgroup containing Malayic and Palawanic languages is unsupported, a borrowing explanation (or a lexical distinction between different types of pangolins) is the only plausible alternative."
29747,scissors,,Loan,Probably a __language__Mota__ loan diffused through the use of __language__Mota__ as the language of instruction in the nineteenth-century London-based Melanesian Mission.
29931,scissors,*guntiŋ ‘scissors’,Loan,"The history of this word is still obscure.  It is almost certainly a loan from some non-Austronesian source, and its distribution in most languages, including all those of the Philippines and eastern Indonesia, probably is a product of borrowing from __language__Malay__.  However, it is also found in __language__Old Javanese__ texts that are centuries old, and its application to terms in carpentry (__language__Bikol__) and house construction (__language__Asilulu__) raises questions about a possible earlier meaning that was later transferred to scissors once these were introduced.



Despite the improbability of it being native, [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) posited ‘Uraustronesisch’ &ast;_guntiŋ_ ‘scissors’, and [Mills (1975)](Source#cldf:mills1975) posited __language__Proto-South Sulawesi__ &ast;_gun(tc)iŋ_ ‘shears; to cut’. The most likely source of this word, which shows irregular sound correspondences in several languages, is some southern form of _Chinese_, but this is yet to be confirmed.  The use of scissors presumably spread widely within a short time because they offered a far more convenient means of cutting hair than was previously possible with the use of single straight blades, as with knives."
30139,scorpion,*kala ‘scorpion’,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, ultimately from Sanskrit.  [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) proposed &ast;_kala_ ‘scorpion’, marking it as a Sanskrit loan, but no satisfactory native term has yet been reconstructed for this meaning."

29881,sell,,Loan,"Also __language__Old Javanese__ _ka-juwal_ ‘sold’ (__language__Malay__?).  The antiquity of this form is unclear.  It’s distribution is entirely within an area that has been subject to Malay-dominated commerce for many centuries, and so the possibility is very real that many of these forms could ultimately be __language__Malay__ loanwords.  The word was present in __language__Old Javanese__ in a form that differs from __language__Malay__ _jual_, suggesting that it has been circulating in western Indonesian for over a millennium, but this is still consistent with a __language__Malay__ source, since Sriwijaya dominated commerce in the Malay archipelago by at least the 7th century AD.
The semantics of Sumatran forms such as __language__Gayō__ _juel-en_ also suggest that if this word is a __language__Malay__ loan it was borrowed early enough to become thoroughly enmeshed in the cultural traditions of the borrowing society."

30647,shell (useful),,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Ilokano__.
30738,shoo!,,Loan,"The origin of this term is unclear.  Domesticated cats probably arrived in the Philippines with the Spanish, so this word probably arose."

30358,silver,*pirak ‘silver’,Loan,"This extremely widespread loanword appears to be of Mon-Khmer origin ([Thurgood 1999:360](Source#cldf:thurgood1999)).  It evidently was acquired by __language__Malay__ as a result of contacts on the mainland of Southeast Asia, and then spread throughout much of western Indonesia-Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan through trade contacts, perhaps mediated by the Dutch presence in southwest Taiwan from 1624-1661, and the Spanish presence in northeast Taiwan from 1626-1642 (the latter out of Manila).  Surprisingly, it is almost totally absent from eastern Indonesia, suggesting that apart from the spice trade, which drew Malays into the Moluccas at an early time, Malay trade routes tended to favor a north-south route.  Based on the comparison of the __language__Tagalog__, __language__Malagasy__, __language__Malay__, __language__Toba Batak__ and __language__Javanese__ forms given here [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) proposed Uraustronesisch &ast;_pirak_ ‘silver’."
30442,silver,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Javanese__. The mechanism of diffusion in this case may have been Javanese influence during the peak of the Majapahit period (1293-1500).  However, it is possible that the Dutch colonial administration was responsible to some extent for the spread of this form, which was used for the colonial _rijksdaalder_, and which was borrowed into some of the Papuan languages of the North Halmahera family, as with Galela _salaka_."

However, the latter form does not appear in any modern dictionary."
29773,star,*bintaŋ,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. This comparison is especially problematic, since it involves an item of basic vocabulary which appears to have been widely borrowed, in most cases presumably replacing a reflex of __language__PAn__ &ast;_bituqen_. In addition to competition with the more widely distributed &ast;_bituqen_, phonological irregularities and the frequently reflected secondary meaning 'medal, decoration' suggest that this comparison is a product of diffusion. On the other hand, the basic character of the term, and its integration into a number of culturally significant expressions (names for stars important in the traditional agricultural calendar, the __language__Karo Batak__ term for rice-milling songs, etc.) give one hesitation about a borrowing hypothesis in particular cases. More precisely we should say that &ast;_bintaŋ_ was an innovation in a language which gave rise to Malay and certain of its closest relatives. With the ever-increasing influence of __language__Malay__ after the rise of Indianized states in southern Sumatra the word then spread to languages which did not inherit it directly (including __language__Malagasy__, which presumably acquired it during the 7th century A.D. in southern Sumatra)."

The attested distribution of both sets of forms almost certainly is the result of borrowing from __language__Malay__, which in turn acquired the word twice, the first time directly from __language__Sanskrit__ with relatively minor phonetic modifications, and the second time through __language__Javanese__. The two words so acquired were then transmitted, probably as a linguistic by-product of Islamic proselytization, from __language__Malay__ into various other languages of Indonesia and the Philippines."

30161,tobacco,,Loan,
30059,tomato,,Loan,"Since it is a native of Mexico the tomato was almost certainly first introduced into Southeast Asia through the Spanish presence in the Philippines, and more specifically through the annual Manila Galleon voyages that connected Manila, a source of Chinese silks, with Acapulco, a source of Mexican and Peruvian silver, from 1565-1815.  The tomato would then most likely have made its landfall in the Philippines in one of the returning galleons that brought its cargo into Manila Bay, where the native population was __language__Tagalog__-speaking.  Presumably the name was misheard and bruited about in the form _kamátis_, in which form it eventually spread throughout the Philippines, but not beyond (note that __language__Chamorro__, spoken in Guam, which was a regular galleon stopover, does not show this sporadic change).  




The __language__Tetun__ word almost certainly derives from Portuguese, and the same may be true of the word in various languages of Sulawesi.  By contrast, the __language__Malay__/Indonesian word appears to derive from Dutch _tomaat_, itself a loanword from Spanish or Portuguese.  Needless to say, the sporadic prenasalization in __language__Western Bukidnon Manobo__, __language__SUBAN__, __language__Mapun__ and __language__Tiruray__ is part of a much larger phenomenon of ‘pandemic irregularity’ characteristic of sound change in hundreds of the languages in insular Southeast Asia ([Blust 1996a](Source#cldf:blust1996))."

30415,tree and its fruit: Lansium domesticum,*lansat ‘name of a tree and its fruit’,Loan,"The history of this word is problematic.  Western Indonesian languages point clearly to &ast;_laŋsat_, but many Philippine languages have forms such as __language__Bikol__ _lansónes_ ‘small edible fruit growing in bunches, possessing a leathery yellow skin and a white segmented inside: _Lansium domesticum_’.  The plant is native to Southeast Asia, but variants of the names _duku_ and _laŋsat_ (cf. __language__Malay__) are found in Thai and Burmese, as well as Austronesian languages.  This leaves little doubt that it is a loanword, but the source remains unknown.  [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) posited Uraustronesisch &ast;_lansat_ ‘name of a tree and its fruit’."

30194,trivet,*tuŋku ‘trivet’,Loan,"Given its meaning one would not expect this to be a loan distribution.  However, three independent pieces of evidence show that the words in __language__Tagalog__, __language__Ngaju Dayak__, __language__Malagasy__ and __language__Javanese__ are almost certainly __language__Malay__ loans.  First, __language__Tagalog__ shows _-_Ɂ corresponding to __language__Malay__ final vowel.  Second, the word is unknown in any language of the Philippines apart from __language__Tagalog__. Third, __language__PMP__ &ast;_dalikan_ is a far better candidate for the meaning ‘trivet, three stones of the hearth’.  


[Zorc (1996)](Source#cldf:zorc1996) took the correspondence of final glottal stop in __language__Tagalog__ to final glottal stop in __language__Iban__ to be evidence for &ast;_-Ɂ_, and so presumably would posit &ast;_tuŋkuɁ_. However, as shown in [Blust (2013; sect. 8.2.2.4)](Source#cldf:blust2013), there are serious problems with the proposal that &ast;_-Ɂ_ existed in __language__PAn__, __language__PMP__, or any early Austronesian proto-language.  



The agreement between __language__Iban__ and __language__Tagalog__ in this case appears instead to be entirely fortuitous: __language__Iban__ added _-Ɂ_ to many words that originally ended in a vowel (or, in some cases a -VC sequence that first monophthongized), and __language__Tagalog__ acquired a final glottal stop in loanwords from __language__Malay__ (mostly __language__Brunei Malay__).  Many __language__Malay__ loanwords entered the Philippines through a trading colony in Manila Bay, where __language__Tagalog__ was spoken natively ([Wolff 1976](Source#cldf:wolff1976)), and in the present case this loan evidently got no further.  



Finally, __language__&ast;dalikan__ ‘trivet’ is unquestionably native, and is found from the Batanes islands, to northern Sumatra, to southern Sulawesi, to the Mariana islands, to Timor in the Lesser Sundas, showing that a better candidate exists for this meaning.  A loanword of this kind suggests that __language__Malay__ contact with the Philippines was rather intimate rather than distant.

However, the Polynesian forms are not clearly related, and since the remaining words are 1. connected with metallurgy, and 2. phonologically irregular since the final consonant is voiceless in some languages in which it would be expected to be voiced (if from &ast;_kawad_) it must be assumed that this word is a loan, although its source is yet to be determined."
30593,wire,,Loan,Borrowing of Spanish _alambre_ ‘wire’.
29943,witness,,Loan,"Also __language__Maranao__ _taksiʔ_ ‘witness’.  This Sanskrit loanword entered __language__Malay__ and __language__Old Javanese__ during the Indianization of western Indonesia.  It was later spread to the Philippines through Malay traders, who probably concentrated their efforts mostly in the __language__Tagalog__-speaking region of Manila Bay.  From __language__Tagalog__ it reached areas of the northern Philippines that apparently never came under direct __language__Malay__ contact influence.  Given his usual practice of including pseudo-reconstructions for loanwords with a distribution that would justify an attribution to his ‘Proto-Indonesian’ if they were native, it is noteworthy that [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) did not include this form.  The reason for this exclusion may have been phonotactic, since a reconstruction &ast;_saksi_ would violate his otherwise exceptionless template of CVCVC forms or CVCCVC forms which were either reduplicated monosyllables or unreduplicated bases with homorganic medial prenasalization.  Finally, the extent to which this form has been integrated into native morphological paradigms is a warning that loanwords cannot easily be detected by their exclusion from indigenous word-building mechanisms."

29851,work,,Loan,"A loanword, probably from  __language__Bunun__  into  __language__Paiwan__, although this remains unclear."
30029,write,*surat ‘writing’,Loan,"Also __language__Javanese (Krama)__) _serat_ ‘letter’.  Most of this comparison is due to borrowing, ultimately from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_surat_ ‘writing’, and [Blust (1976:33)](Source#cldf:blust1976) noted that “Since all reported ‘indigenous’ scripts in Indonesia and the Philippines ... appear to be based on Indian originals, there is no known physical reason to suppose a pre-Indian tradition of ‘bamboo literacy’.  &ast;_surat_ is not a Sanskrit loanword, however, invariably and exclusively refers to writing, and must have existed in western Indonesia only slightly later than the earliest inscriptions in an Indian-based script.  It therefore seems unlikely that writing was introduced to Indonesia entirely as a result of direct or stimulus diffusion from India.”  



Whatever the origin of this word, it now seems safest to assume that it came to refer to writing in the Malay world only after the introduction of Indic scripts.  What is most remarkable is its occurrence (with irregular sound correspondences) in several Formosan languages, presumably as a result of the Dutch commericial and proselytizing presence in southwest Taiwan from 1624-1661.  Since the short-lived Dutch colonization of Taiwan was staged from Batavia it is very likely that it would have included __language__Malay__ speakers, and one can only assume in the absence of direct historical evidence that some of these Malays introduced elements of literacy to the Siraya.  However, the historical records we have indicate that the earliest Dutch contact with Taiwan in October, 1623, was a fleet under the command of Cornelis Reyerson that included “a small following of soldiers and Bandanese slaves”, but apparently no Malays ([Blusse and Roessingh 1984:66](bib-Blusse)).  Nonetheless, the observations that were made of the Siraya-speaking Soulang village claim that the population at that time already used “many __language__Malay__ words”.  While this can be interpreted as meaning only that the Dutch recognized __language__Siraya__ cognates of __language__Malay__ words they already knew -- much as they did two decades earlier in stating that there was “much of __language__Malay__ in __language__Malagasy__” -- several cited forms are distinctively __language__Malay__, and not __language__Siraya__, as with _babij_ ‘pig’, _tacot_ ‘afraid’, _boesoek_ ‘rotten’, _maccan_ ‘to eat’, or _ican_ ‘fish’.  Some of the Dutch in this contingent speculated that these words might have been introduced by Malay sailors from Johore who had preceded them in reaching southwest Taiwan, but this raises the question why similar contacts would not have happened along the west coast of northern Luzon.  The presence of _sulal_ in __language__Kavalan__ is more plausibly attributed to contact with __language__Tagalog__ speakers who accompanied the Spanish during their even briefer colonization of northeast Taiwan from 1626-1642.  



Finally, the forms in some of the languages of Sulawesi, as __language__Bare'e__ and __language__Tae'__ suggest that __language__Malay__ _surat_ may have arisen from __language__PWMP__ &ast;_suRat_ ‘to carve, incise’, and spread widely during the apogee of Sriwijaya after undergoing semantic change.  A connection with __language__PWMP__ &ast;_suRat_ ‘wound’ seems less likely."
30199,write,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, although the gloss of the __language__Toba Batak__ form suggests that this may have been a more widespread form that originally referred to natural markings, as on animal pelts.  [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) proposed an etymological chimera, comparing the western Indonesian forms with __language__Tagalog__ _túlis_ ‘point, sharp end; spire;; anything tapering and pointed’, which is better assigned to __language__PWMP__ &ast;_tirus_ ‘tapering, attenuating to a point’, and with __language__Samoan__ _tusi_ ‘point (with finger); draw; write’, etc., and other Polynesian forms that are best assigned to __language__PCEMP__ &ast;_tusi_ ‘draw, make marks or designs’."
30143,yellow,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. The relationship between this term and __language__PMP__ &ast;_kunij_ ‘turmeric: _Curcuma longa_ (tuber that yields a yellow dye)’ remains unclear.  The latter term regularly became __language__Karo Batak__ _kuniŋ_ ‘turmeric’, since final voiced stops were nasalized in Northern Batak.  It is possible that it was acquired in this form by early __language__Malay__ speakers, although borrowing from __language__Karo Batak__ to __language__Malay__ seems very unlikely. Terms for __language__PMP__ &ast;_kamuniŋ_ ‘a tree: _Murraya_ spp.’, on the other hand, appear to be monomorphemic, but may have been reinterpreted in languages that have kuniŋ as affixed forms of this base."
