Root,Roots,"
    Because many reconstructed morphemes contain smaller submorphemic sound-meaning associations
    of the type that Brandstetter (1916) called ‘roots’ (Wurzeln), I felt that a module collecting
    these elements into one place would be useful. The ‘Roots’ module of the ACD thus amounts to
    a continuation of the data set presented in Blust 1988.

Loan,Loans,"
    Loanwords are a perennial problem in historical linguistics. When they involve morphemes that
    are borrowed between related languages they can provoke questions about the regularity of sound
    correspondences. When they involve morphemes that are borrowed between unrelated languages they
    can give rise to invalid reconstructions. Dempwolff (1934-38) included a number of known
    loanwords among his 2,216 ‘Proto-Austronesian’ reconstructions in order to show that sound
    correspondences are often regular even with loanwords that are borrowed relatively early, but
    he marked these with an ‘x’, as with *xbazu ‘shirt’, which he knew to be a Persian loanword in
    many of the languages of western Indonesia, and (via Malay) in some of the languages of the
    Philippines. However, he overlooked a number of cases, such as *nanas ‘pineapple’ (an Amazonian
    cultigen that was introduced to insular Southeast Asia by the Portuguese). Since widely
    distributed loanwords can easily be confused with native forms I have found it useful to
    include them in a separate module of the dictionary.

    A fairly careful (but inevitably imperfect) attempt has been made to identify and document
    loanwords with a distribution sufficient to justify a reconstruction on one of the eight levels
    of the ACD, if treated erroneously as native. While this has been done wherever the possibility
    of confusion with native forms seemed real, there is no reason to include obvious loans that
    would never be mistaken for native forms.

    This issue is especially evident in the Philippines, where hundreds of Spanish loanwords from
    the colonial period that began late in the 16th century, are scattered from at least Ilokano in
    northern Luzon to the Bisayan languages of the central Philippines and some of the languages of
    Mindanao (as Subanon). Comparisons like Ilokano kamarón ‘prawn’, Cebuano kamarún ‘dish of
    shrimps, split and dipped in eggs, optionally mixed with ground meat’ < Spanish camarón
    ‘shrimp’, or Ilokano kalábus ‘jail, prison’, Cebuano kalabús, kalabúsu ‘jail; to land in
    prison, in jail’ < Spanish calabozo ‘dungeon’ seem inappropriate for inclusion in LOANS, but
    introduced plants have generally been admitted. Some of these, as ‘tomato’ may be widely known
    as New World plants that were introduced to the Philippines by the Spanish, but others, as
    ‘chayote’, may be less familiar. As already noted, Dempwolff (1938) posited
    ‘Uraustronesisch’ *nanas and *kenas as doublets for ‘pineapple’, completely overlooking the
    fact that this is an Amazonian plant that could hardly have been present in the Austronesian
    world before the advent of the colonial period. This example shows that errors in the semantic
    domain of plant names can sometimes escape detection by scholars who are otherwise known for
    their careful, meticulous work, and for this reason all borrowed cognate sets involving plant
    names are documented as loanwords to avoid any possible misinterpretation.

Noise,Chance Resemblances,"Given the number of languages being compared and the number of forms in 
many of the sources, forms that resemble one another in shape and meaning by chance will not be 
uncommon, and the decision as to whether a comparison that appears good is a product of chance 
must be based on criteria such as

- how general the semantic category of the form is (e.g. phonologically corresponding forms 
  meaning ‘cut’ are less diagnostic of relationship than phonologically corresponding forms for 
  particular types of cutting),
- how richly attested the form is (if it is found in just two witnesses the likelihood that it is 
  a product of chance is greatly increased),
- there is already a well-established reconstruction for the same meaning.
