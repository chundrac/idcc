24941,article,pawley1972[58];walshandbiggs1966[];clark1976[],*a₁,"The history of this morpheme is problematic.  In the Solomons and in Central Pacific languages reflexes of &ast;_a_ function as a personal article, in contrast to the common noun article &ast;_na_.  [Pawley (1972:58)](Source#cldf:pawley1972) reconstructs ""PEOc"" &ast;_na_/_a_ ‘common article’, and &ast;_(q)a_ ‘personal article’, thus positing a rather dubious distinction between contrasting articles &ast;_a_ and &ast;_(q)a_.  Similarly, [Walsh and Biggs (1966)](Source#cldf:walshandbiggs1966) posit PPn &ast;_ʔa_ ‘personal article’, but reconstruct &ast;_ʔ-_ purely on the basis of [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _ʔa-_. Since [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) is known to have added initial glottal stop in the reflexes of some other grammatical morphemes ([Clark 1976](Source#cldf:clark1976)) the evidence for distinguishing &ast;_a_ ‘common article’ and &ast;_qa_ ‘personal article’ appears to be dangerously thin.  This morpheme may be a sporadic shortening of &ast;_na_ which happened independently in a number of [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages.

Although non-[Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) witnesses point consistently to &ast;_atas_ (with metathesis of the first vowel and consonant in [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh)) the reconstruction of a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) etymon is more problematic.  [Tsuchida (1983)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1983) identifies the [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) stem as _-Tas_, since e.g. _i-Tas_ ‘up, above’ lacks an initial stem vowel.  If this analysis is adopted, however, comparison of the [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) and extra-[Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) material becomes difficult.  


To explain the missing initial vowel in [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) _-Tas_ we might posit a stem &ast;_Caqas_ which is prefixed both in [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](LanguageTable#cldf:18964) _a-Tas_ ‘high’, and in all [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:MP) languages.  This hypothesis offers the minor advantage of deriving the Central Philippine forms without metathesis, but creates two more serious problems: 1) it forces us to assume an irregular loss of _-H-_ with contraction of the resulting vowel sequence in [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386), and 2) it forces us to assume that all non-[Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) reflexes outside the central Philippines contain an independently reconstructible prefix or particle (presumably &ast;_qa_ ‘locative particle’) which has become fossilized.  While this analysis may work for most reflexes in [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:MP) languages, it is not clear that the initial vowel in [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](LanguageTable#cldf:18964) _a-Tas_ ‘high’ has any connection with &ast;_Sa_; the same must be said for the morphologically corresponding but probably convergent form [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _ha-taʔás_ ‘very long; high’.  As a compromise, then, I assume that [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](LanguageTable#cldf:18964) _-Tas_ shows an irregular loss of the first syllable vowel.  Finally, [Ross (1988:276)](Source#cldf:ross1988) reconstructs [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_qatas_ ‘summit, top’, but provides no supporting evidence for the initial consonant.",PAN,Canonical
24773,death,dempwolff193438[sect. 47e],*aCay,"Also [Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246) _etéy_ ‘death’, _pátay_ ‘any sacrifice performed on behalf of the village’, [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226) _ka-mátay-on_ ‘death’, [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _mate_ ‘the late, the deceased’, [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) _mate_ ‘die; dead; the deceased; kill, slay’, [Lamaholot](LanguageTable#cldf:19031) _maté-n_ ‘already dead, not moving any more’, [Fordata](LanguageTable#cldf:18184) _matta_ ‘die; dead; go out (fire, light)’, [Kowiai/Koiwai](LanguageTable#cldf:304) _matata_ ‘corpse’, [Marshallese](LanguageTable#cldf:833) _mij_ ‘dead; numb; death’, [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362) _mase_ ‘die’.  Since all of the forms that Dempwolff compared contain a reflex either of &ast;_p-_ or of &ast;_m-_, he reconstructed both &ast;_patay_ and &ast;_matay_ ‘die, dead’. However, rather than list these reconstructions with the relevant supporting evidence separately, as was his practice with doublets, he posited paired etyma &ast;_patay_, &ast;_matay_ at the head of a single mixed comparison, with an empty cross-reference to &ast;_matay_.  The explanation for this treatment is given in [Dempwolff (1934-38:sect. 47e)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438), where it is suggested that &ast;_matay_ is derived from &ast;_patay_ by nasal substitution, but is sufficiently widespread (being found in ‘Indonesian’, ‘Melanesian’ and Polynesian languages) to require a separate reconstruction.  This was perhaps the closest Dempwolff came to the reconstruction of morphology. 


The evidence now available shows that the unaffixed [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) base in question was &ast;_aCay_.  Dempwolff's &ast;_patay_ and &ast;_matay_ can most convincingly be derived from &ast;_pa-aCay_ ‘kill’  (with causative &ast;_pa-_) and &ast;_ma-aCay_ ‘dead’ (with stative &ast;_ma-_).  That the base began with a vowel rather than &ast;_q-_ is clear from such reflexes as [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _atađ_ ‘kill’, [Kalamian Tagbanwa](LanguageTable#cldf:18285) _patay_ ‘dead’, [Moken](LanguageTable#cldf:341) _matay_ ‘die; dead’, [Muna](LanguageTable#cldf:350) _mate_ ‘die; dead’, [Lou](LanguageTable#cldf:322) _mat_ ‘die; dead’, and [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _mate_ ‘die; dead’.  The merger of &ast;_q-_ and zero in many attested languages would have led to homophony between reflexes of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_aCay_ ‘death’ and &ast;_qaCay_ ‘liver’, both of which figured in numerous expressions relating to the emotions.  Possibly to avoid such potentially awkward homophony the unaffixed base was lost in the great majority of languages, leaving reflexes of &ast;_pa-aCay_ and &ast;_ma-aCay_ as effective secondary base forms for further morphological elaboration.  Thus, next to [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_pa-aCay_ and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_pa-atay_ ‘kill’ there is a priori evidence for e.g. [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_pa(ka)-m-atay_ ‘kill’ and [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) &ast;_ka-m-atay-an_ ‘affected by a death’, where the outer affixation evidently was added to an already prefixed base.  


The alternative hypothesis, that forms such as [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _atađ_ ‘kill’, [Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569) _atë_ ‘die; dead; death’ or [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _ate_ are products of analogical back-formation from a base &ast;_paCay_ or &ast;_maCay_ is more difficult to maintain in view of the fairly clear (though by no means universal) association of reflexes of the former with the causative ‘kill’ and of reflexes of the latter with the stative ‘dead’. Partly by analogy with &ast;_ma-qudip_ ‘living, alive’, I have attributed all reflexes that Dempwolff would have assigned to &ast;_matay_ to [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_ma-aCay_, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_ma-atay_, [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCEMP) &ast;_matay_, [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_mate_.  It is possible that these forms actually represent a conflation of &ast;_ma-aCay_ ‘dead’ (stative) and &ast;_um-aCay_ ‘die’ (active), since the initial vowel in reflexes of  &ast;_in-atay_ generally disappeared even though it was retained in most other forms, and we would expect a parallel treatment of the initial vowel of &ast;_um-atay_.  Nonetheless, pairs such as [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _mate_ ‘die; dead’, _in-ate_ ‘killed’ suggest that the former does contain a reflex of &ast;_ma-_ rather than &ast;_um-_.  The same apparently must be assumed in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_m-in-atay_ ‘person who has died, corpse’ (= &ast;_m-in-a-atay_, with contraction of the sequence of like vowels), despite the fact that the co-occurrence of &ast;_ma-_ ‘stative’ and &ast;_-in-_ ‘perfective’ is otherwise rare.  


Because of occasional ambiguities in the morphology it is possible that I have posited some morphologically complex forms of &ast;_aCay_ and its reflexes which are in reality products of convergent innovation.  Examples include &ast;_m-atay-an_ ‘lose someone through death’, &ast;_paŋ-m-atay_ ‘means of killing(?)’, &ast;_ka-p-atay-an_ ‘end of death of something(?)’ and &ast;_ka-p-atay-en_ ‘death(?)’.  As implied in passing above, it appears likely that the prefix of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_ma-aCay_ was reinterpreted as part of the stem in [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCEMP) &ast;_matay_.  The only known counterevidence to this claim is [Bimanese](LanguageTable#cldf:241) _h-ade_ ‘kill, extinguish a fire’ and [Soboyo](LanguageTable#cldf:419) _n-ate_ ‘2sg, 3sg and 3pl form of _m-ate_ ‘die’. Finally, although Dempwolff reconstructed both &ast;_patay_ and &ast;_matay_ with the meaning ‘die, dead’ it is clear from the data assembled here that by at least [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) times a far richer complex of meanings was associated with &ast;_atay_, whether alone, affixed, or in combination with various other free morphemes.

[Blust (1977:8-9)](Source#cldf:blust1977) suggested that &ast;_kaSu_ ‘2sg’ next to &ast;_iSu_ ‘2sg.’ arose from &ast;_ka-iSu_ through a blend of the first syllable of &ast;_kamu_ ‘2pl.’ with the 2sg. base, and [Ross (2006:533)](bib-Ross) has suggested that this pattern was extended to other persons and numbers; the matter remains unsettled.  



A number of CEMP languages have lost &ast;_k-_ through regular sound change, and reflexes like _ami_ are assigned to &ast;_k-ami_ on the assumption that they reflect the more common form.

24851,verbal suffix marking locative voice; nominal suffix marking location,,*-an,"&ast;_-an_ is one of the more important affixes that can be reconstructed for [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP).  The reflexes in such languages as [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493), [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Murut (Timugon)](LanguageTable#cldf:1067) and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) show that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_-an_ probably could co-occur with &ast;_-in-_ in past temporal expressions, and examples in other languages suggest that the final element in [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) &ast;_ka-_ (stem) _-an_ was identical to &ast;_-an_.  Reflexes of &ast;_-an_ are often the exclusive or principle morphological means of expressing the ‘locative focus’ in Philippine languages, and at the same time are commonly used to derive nouns of location.  It is, however, perhaps an oversimplification to associate &ast;_-an_ exclusively with semantic properties that can be characterized in a straightforward sense as ‘locative’.  To judge from its functioning reflexes in modern [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) and Philippine languages, and from its fossilized reflexes in other languages, &ast;_-an_ had multiple functions (alternatively, we might recognize more than one homophonous suffix).  



Thus, many of the languages of western Borneo have a form _tapan_ ‘winnowing basket’ (active verb: _napan_ ‘to winnow grain’) which reflects [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_tahep_ ‘up and down movement of grains being winnowed’ + &ast;_-an_, here receiving a more natural universal interpretation as instrumental rather than locative.  Particularly interesting is &ast;_tian-an_ ‘pregnant’ (from &ast;_tian_ ‘abdomen’ + &ast;_-an_), found in a number of WMP and OC languages, since here the suffix clearly was used adjectivally in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP).  Like &ast;_-en_, reflexes of &ast;_-an_ sometimes mean ‘inflicted with’ or ‘suffering from’ the referent of the base ([Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325), [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573)). In general the use of &ast;_-an_ decreases sharply as one moves southward from the Philippines, and eastward in Indonesia. The evidence for [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_-an_ is slim, but difficult to dismiss, although it probably was something of a relic affix in the eastern region of the Austronesian-speaking world even at this early time.",PAN,Canonical

None of the known Philippine reflexes refers specifically to a phosphorescent millipede, but two considerations favor the gloss I have given.  First, the semantic reflexes in [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) and the South Sulawesi languages agree closely in referring to such an insect.  Second, on the whole semantic extensions proceed by generalizing properites of the concrete objects of experience rather than by concretizing a priori general properties.  I thus consider it unlikely that &ast;_andap_ referred to phosphorescence as such.  It is probable that some still undeterminded morpheme which was marked by the &ast;_qali/kali-_ prefix also meant ‘luminous millipede’ ([Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243) _halimañar_ ‘luminous millipede’, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _kelemayar_ ‘luminous millipede’, [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _katikeran_ ‘phosphorescent millipede’, [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _hatitioran_ ‘phosphorescent millipede’, [Ambai](LanguageTable#cldf:472) _halimontan_ ‘phosphorescent light of luminous millipede or toadstool’, [Malay (Jakarta)](LanguageTable#cldf:18430) _kalimayah_ ‘luminous millipede’, [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _andaʔ kalamoyan_ ‘phosphorescent millipede’).



David Mead (email of January 18, 2015) informs me that “in all of Southeast Asia there are only two described luminous _centipede_ species, of which only the first one listed below -- because of its wide distribution -- could have been the reference of &ast;_andap_.



1. _Orphnaeus brevilabiatus_ (Newport 1845), a small soil centipede, thread-like body about 3 cm long, 1 mm in diameter with 67 to 81 pairs of legs, known from Africa through Hawaii and the Galapagos Islands, a widely distributed ""tropical tramp species"" 


2. _Otostigmus aculeatus_ (Haase 1887) a small tropical centipede with a dark grey body (with prototypical centipede body shape); known distribution includes ""China; Indonesia (Java); Laos; Taiwan; Vietnam.



The confusion of _O. brevilabiatus_ with millipedes has two sources. First, the small size, elongated body shape and numerous leg pairs have caused non-specialists to confuse it with (true) millipedes -- and probably even more so when seen at night under dim lighting conditions. Second, the Dutch term _duizenpoot_, which can refer to both millipedes and centipedes, has probably added another layer of complexity when Dutch sources have been (mis)translated. There is no confusion on the part of myriapodologists, but, sadly, it must be laid at the feet of linguists and lexicographers. Thus, for example, Smith and Schmidgall-Tellings include in their _Comprehensive Indonesian-English Dictionary_ the self-contradictory entry: ""_kelemayar_ luminous millipede, glow-worm, _Orphnaeus brevilabiatus_."" And for a quarter-century in Sulawesi we employed a word list which asked for, as one of its items, the local word for ‘luminescent millipede’!”",PWMP,Canonical

First, all languages except [Minangkabau](LanguageTable#cldf:337), [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) are ambiguous for the contrast of &ast;_q-_ and zero.

The evidence for the onset is thus contradictory.  Similarly, [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226), [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) and [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) unambiguously support &ast;_-ʔ_, whereas [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _agúho_, [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _agúho_ contrarily support &ast;_-u_ ([Zorc 1982:115](Source#cldf:zorc1982)).

Since original medial nasals are otherwise retained in [Lonwolwol](LanguageTable#cldf:320) and since none of the other languages from which cognates are cited here could regularly reflect [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_pano_ (or [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_panaw_) Paton's interpretation of the [Lonwolwol](LanguageTable#cldf:320) form appears to be unjustified. 


This cognate set appears in [Blust (1993b:254)](Source#cldf:blust1993), where it is observed that [Nothofer (1992)](Source#cldf:nothofer1992), favors a comparison with [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _bayaʔ_ ‘go’ < [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_bayaq_.

This is one of the extremely rare monosyllables that appears to have been a content morpheme in [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCEMP). Although the glosses for CMP languages suggest that it was a main verb, several of the Oceanic reflexes indicate that it was an auxiliary, and as such it may have been unstressed and so a part of the following phonological word (hence the comment by [Codrington and Palmer (1896)](bib-Codrington) that [Mota](LanguageTable#cldf:344) _va_ ‘go or come’ is sometimes hard to distinguish from the causative prefix _va-_).",PCEMP,Canonical

30164,female,blust1982[],*bahi,"As noted in [Blust (1982b)](Source#cldf:blust1982) from a morphological standpoint this is one of the most challenging of all Austronesian comparisons.  In addition to the reduplicated and infixed forms of &ast;_bahi_ that are reconstructed here there are numerous other affixed forms that are confined to particular languages or genetically restricted groups of languages, and a few that are widespread but semantically heterogeneous.  


The following is a selection of affixed bases that may or may not indicate proto-forms with similar morphology: 1) [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _ka-babai_ ‘the smaller part of a pair’, [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _ka-babai_ ‘feminine — esp. applied to female nut called _togaiaq_’, 2) [Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246) _ka-babaiy-an_ ‘sister or female cousin of a male Ego’, [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289) _ka-babai-an_ ‘girl, maiden, lass’, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _ka-babai-han_ ‘womanhood; women as a group’, [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _ka-babayi-an_ ‘women’, [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _ka-babayi-nan_ ‘women as a group’, 3) [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) _maki-baya-bayan_ ‘copulate’, [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _maki-babbáy_ ‘be concupiscent, lustful’, 4) [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) _bayi-ʔán_ ‘doe, the female of deer’, [Binukid](LanguageTable#cldf:19012) _bahi-an_, and [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _behi-ʔan_ ‘female animal’.  


The last of these may point to [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) _&ast;bahi-ʔan_ ‘female, of animals’, but this inference would be much more secure if a similar meaning were found in other, more distantly related languages.  While similar forms do occur in Taiwan, elsewhere in the Philippines and in Malagasy, their meanings are widely divergent ([Rukai (Tona)](LanguageTable#cldf:970) _abayánə_, [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) _ba-bay-an_, [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _va-vay-an_ ‘woman’, [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) _ba-bay-án_ ‘sexual organs of a woman’, [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _bayi-nan_ ‘people on the bride’s side in a marriage’, [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _va-vai-ána_ ‘be made to have a companion’), and so no higher-order reconstruction appears possible at present.  


Finally, like several other nouns referring to people the word for ‘woman’ appears to have had a plural form distinguished by length of the penultimate vowel, as in [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) , [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) and most Polynesian languages.  Cross-cutting the evidence for plural marking by lengthening of the penult is the evidence from several languages in western Melanesia for a singular : plural distinction based on the contrast of /_a_/ and /_i_/ [Molima](LanguageTable#cldf:18975) _wavine_ ‘woman’ : _wivine_ ‘women’, etc.).  If this distinction is posited for [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) it may help to explain the otherwise irregular first-syllable /_i_/ in a number of other languages that are not known to distinguish plural from singular in this way, as [Nali](LanguageTable#cldf:878) _pihin_, [Sori](LanguageTable#cldf:1021) _bibiŋ_, [Wuvulu](LanguageTable#cldf:445) _pifine_, [Tanga](LanguageTable#cldf:425) _fifin_ or [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362) _fifine_ ‘woman’.",PAN,Canonical

In view of this characterization it is somewhat surprising that a cognate is found in [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062), which is spoken around Sun-Moon Lake, at an elevation of nearly 1000 meters in the western foothills of the Central Mountains of Taiwan.  There is evidence that [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) was spoken on Taiwan's Western Plain ([Blust 1996](Source#cldf:blust1996)), perhaps as recently as the 17th century, but even then it probably would not have been in contact with the sea. However, the _Crinum asiaticum_ is reported from inland riverine environments in Indonesia as well (cf. reflexes in [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) and [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276)).  In any event [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _fakun_ was spontaneously offered as the name of the _Crinum asiaticum_ when a color photograph of the latter was presented to Mr. Shih A-shan, and there can be little doubt about the botanical identification.",PAN,Canonical

For convenience in perceiving semantic groupings the reflexes have been segregated into three clusters, but all are believed to continue the same etymon.  The lexicographical issue at stake is how the linguist can distinguish homophony from polysemy in a principled way in cases such as this.  On the one hand we could posit homophones (1) &ast;_baliw_ ‘answer, oppose; opposite side or part; partner, friend, enemy’; (2) &ast;_baliw_ ‘repay, return in kind; retaliate, take revenge (hence: to equalize a loss or debt)’; and (3) &ast;_baliw_ ‘don mourning apparel; mourn for a deceased spouse’.  


However, there are multiple problems with this analysis.  First, &ast;_-iw_ occurs in only three of the over 2,200 reconstructions in [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) (&ast;_baliw_ ‘change’, &ast;_baRiw_ ‘spoiled, tainted’, &ast;_laRiw_ ‘flee’), and it would therefore be unexpected to find this rare diphthong in three additional morphemes all of which are homophonous with &ast;_baliw_ ‘change’.  Second, suffixed forms reflecting &ast;_baliw-an_ occur in at least the semantic clusters (b) and (c).  Third, and most critically, all three semantic clusters are related by a pervasive notion of duality, and are fully consistent with descriptions of the psychology of dual divisions in the ethnological literature (see [Blust 1980a](Source#cldf:blust1980), [Blust 1981b](Source#cldf:blust1981) for further discussion).  


On the other hand, we could unite at least the material cited here, as indeed we have done.  Dempwolff did not consider this material, but as noted already he split &ast;_baliw_₂ into two separate etyma.  Later writers, as [Mills (1975)](Source#cldf:mills1975) have made similar decisions (in favor of homophony rather than polysemy) for some of the material cited under &ast;_baliw_₁ (a).  There can now be little question that all of the forms gathered under &ast;_baliw_₁ reflect a single etymon.  It is, moreover, likely that &ast;_baliw_₁ and &ast;_baliw_₂ were the same morpheme. However, the rather distinct character of the glosses associated with reflexes of &ast;_baliw_₂, particularly those relating to punitive storms ([Blust 1981](Source#cldf:blust1981)), is difficult to reconcile with a hypothesis of a unitary [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) etymon &ast;_baliw_. Formally most [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) cognates appear to reflect the nasal grade of &ast;_b_, but a few languages ([Lakalai](LanguageTable#cldf:877), [Mota](LanguageTable#cldf:344), [Lonwolwol](LanguageTable#cldf:320)) evidently reflect the oral grade. I am indebted to Ann Chowning and Ross Clark (p.c.) for useful comments and data relating to this comparison.

The fuller comparison given here suggests that the supporting evidence cited by Dempwolff belongs to a single cognate set in which the rare diphthong &ast;_-iw_ was occasionally altered by metathesis.  Next to its more general meaning it is clear that by [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) times &ast;_baliw_ referred to a supernatural punitive storm precipitated by incest or mockery of animals (see [Blust 1981](Source#cldf:blust1981) for a fuller discussion).  Although a belief in such punitive storms is also found among speakers of [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) and [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages, as the [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) of Flores and the [Suau](LanguageTable#cldf:1022) of southeast New Guinea, it is unclear whether a reflex of &ast;_baliw_ is used to designate them, and hence whether the meaning of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_baliw_ included this referent.",PAN,Canonical

With regard to the last consonant [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _balixi_, _falixi_ unambiguously indicates &ast;_j_, but [Pak](LanguageTable#cldf:371) _penit_, [Nauna](LanguageTable#cldf:355) _pelic_ point to [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_ns_, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_z_, all other known reflexes being indeterminate.  Although this item can be securely reconstructed, the supporting cognate set is problematic in this and in certain other respects.  
First, northern Philippine forms such [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289) _balíli_ ‘a rush: _Juncus effusus L._’ and [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) _balíli_ ‘kind of tough grass with long leaves’ are either similar to the above forms by chance, or exhibit an unparalleled development of &ast;_j_, and &ast;_z_.  It is thus possible that all Philippine forms reflect an etymon &ast;_balili_ which is distinct from &ast;_baliji_ or &ast;_balizi_.  


Second, the two intervocalic consonants in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_palisi_ appear to have metathesized independently in at least three [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages: [Proto-Willaumez](LanguageTable#cldf:19093), [Selau](LanguageTable#cldf:410) (and perhaps other languages of Buka and Bougainville), and [Proto-Micronesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19079).

[POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_paluja_ > [Proto-Micronesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19079) &ast;_fasula_ ‘to paddle’).  


Nonetheless the possibility remains that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) had doublets &ast;_palisi_ and &ast;_pasili_ which show a complementary pattern of retention.  Finally, it is unclear whether [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_baliji_, &ast;_balizi_ referred to a particular type of grass, or whether it functioned as a generic term.  If the latter was the case this reconstruction runs counter to the claim of [Brown (1984)](Source#cldf:brown1984) that the generic category ‘tree’ is always lexically encoded before the generic category ‘grass’.",PMP,Canonical

Reflexes of &ast;_balutu_ are widely distributed throughout the Philippines, while reflexes of a variant &ast;_barutu_ also occur in Southern Luzon, the Bisayas, and Mindanao. A [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) etymon &ast;_balutu_ thus seems fairly secure. In addition, [Stresemann (1927)](Source#cldf:stresemann1927) posited ""Sub-Ambon"" &ast;_balutu_ ‘sailboat’ based solely on [Saparua](LanguageTable#cldf:990) _palutu_. Together with the Philippine forms this reconstruction suggests a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) term &ast;_balutu_ which referred to some type of boat. However, Stresemann's source for [Saparua](LanguageTable#cldf:990) ([van Hoëvell 1877](bib-van)) does not list _palutu_. Collins (p.c.) notes that similar, but apparently non-corresponding forms are found in some languages on the north coast of Seram (Salas _palút_, Benggoi _balútam_, Kobi _balóta_). However, the lack of clear cognates outside the Philippines, and the feebleness of attestation in the Moluccas raises suspicions that this form was not found in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP). 


[Samal](LanguageTable#cldf:981) _balutu_ ‘kind of outrigger canoe’ is assumed to be a Philippine loan, and it is possible that the Moluccan forms were borrowed from Sama-Bajaw sea nomads. As support for this view, Collins (p.c.) reports that other names for types of boats were introduced into the Moluccas during the recent past by immigrants from Sulawesi. Moreover, there are other linguistic indications of the incursion of [Samal](LanguageTable#cldf:981) speakers into Indonesia, as with [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) _balaŋiŋiʔ_ ‘sea nomad’ (a reference to the Balangingi Samal).

 It is unclear why a number of languages extending from the Philippines to Melanesia have an irregular /_o_/ in the last syllable of this word.  A possible explanation is that the [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) or [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) form contained a rare last syllable &ast;_o_, but for the present I choose not to increase the number of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) or [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) vowels through the reconstruction of questionable distinctions such as this.  The essential meaning of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_baŋuN_ and its reflexes through at least [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) was ‘wake up, get up from sleeping’.  It is clear from a number of affixed reflexes that this word did not refer simply to the psychological act of awakening from sleep, but more particularly to the physical act of arising after awakening.  It is evidently the latter semantic component which has been elaborated in many of the languages of the Philippines and Indonesia into transitive verbs which refer to the physical action of erecting or setting something upright, or to the symbolic act of establishing something from nothing.",PAN,Canonical

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_bagi_, but marked it as a Sanskrit loan.  A similar interpretation of [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) _bagi_ is found in [Goris (1938)](Source#cldf:goris1938).  However, [Wilkinson (1959)](Source#cldf:wilkinson1959) does not mark [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _bagi_, _bahagi_ as a loan, and the form is conspicuously absent in [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660).  Moreover, the agreement of [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _-ʔC-_ with [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _-haC-_ parallels a correspondence in an indisputably native form: [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _baʔru_, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _baharu_ ‘new’.  The quality of the deleted vowel in this word evidently differed from that in &ast;_baqeRu_ (&ast;_baqeRu_ > _baharu_ ~ _bahru_ ~ _baru_, but &ast;_baqegi_ > _bahagi_, _bagi_ without a variant &ast;&ast;_bahgi_).  



Dempwolff's interpretation appears to be based on the assumption that this form derives from Sanskrit _bhāgya_ ‘good fortune, luck’ (see ‘Loans and convergent developments’). Indeed a confusion of these two words ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _bahagi_, _bagi_ ‘mete out, apportion’, and _bahagia_ ‘good fortune sent by God’) is apparent in some languages: e.g. [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _bagiʔ-an_ ‘share, portion, belong to, fate’, where the native [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) word and the Sanskrit loan are both borrowed (from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326)) and treated as a single polysemous form, presumably on the notion that one's inheritance equals one's fortune or fate.  


Although this word appears to be native in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), and some other languages, part of the attested distribution, including the forms in [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331), [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), and perhaps all [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CEMP) languages, probably is due to borrowing from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326).",PMP,Canonical

The present reconstruction has the merit of reconciling the [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) and [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) forms, but leaves the reflex of &ast;_r_ irregular both in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and in [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235).  A fairly thorough search for other reflexes which might resolve some of these problems has produced no results.  If this form is not a local innovation which has been spread by borrowing, it is puzzling why no other reflexes have been uncovered. 


On the other hand, if it is a local innovation the most likely route of diffusion would be from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) into [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), yet the disagreement of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _-b-_, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _-w-_ argues against this interpretation.

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_ba-Rani_ ‘fearless’, cross-referenced to &ast;_Rani_ ‘courage, manliness’.  However, the latter form is based solely on [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _hañi_ (apparently a back-formation from &ast;&ast;_bahani_, which was assumed to contain the common verb prefix _ba-_) and the arbitrarily segmented final portion of [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _taŋ-ane_, [Futunan](LanguageTable#cldf:607) _t-ane_ ‘man, male’.

In [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) only the more general meaning ‘brave, fearless; to dare’ can be justified.  Finally, it is unclear from the isolated [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) reflex which preserves a final vowel whether the sporadic change &ast;_-i_ > /_e_/ had already occurred in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC), or whether it took place at some time between the break-up of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) and the emergence of [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396) as a distinct language.",PMP,Canonical

The rich attestation of this form in _Taiwan_ and the _Philippines_ contrasts markedly with its rarity elsewhere. Known reflexes are entirely lacking in Borneo and Sulawesi, occur in only three [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages outside the Philippines, in only two [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) languages and in a single subgroup of [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages (cf. [Bender et al.  2003](Source#cldf:benderetal2003), [Proto-Micronesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19079) &ast;_fara_ ‘lungs’).  



The gemination in [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289) _ballá_ presumably is to be explained by the shortness of the preceding unstressed vowel (although such a conditioned change is not regular), while the [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291), [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273), [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433), and [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) reflexes are Central Philippine  loans.  Among other irregularities, [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _va_, [Palawan Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:247) _bagá_ ‘lungs’ suggest the need for a doublet &ast;_baRa_.  However, contrary to [Warren (1959)](Source#cldf:warren1959), [Reid (1971)](Source#cldf:reid1971) gives [Palawan Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:247) _bagaʔ_ ‘lungs’.  On the other hand, [Reid (1971)](Source#cldf:reid1971) lists [Manobo (Ilianen)](LanguageTable#cldf:822) _baha_ ‘lungs’ without an expected final consonant, and [Ho (1978)](Source#cldf:ho1978) shows that the lack of expected _-q_ is common to all five [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) dialects that he examines.  For the present these are assumed to be independent irregularities, although it is possible that doublets &ast;_baRaq_, &ast;_baRa_ already existed in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN). 

Finally, the independent testimony of [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) and [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) suggests that a conceptual link between the lungs (associated with the breath = life force, soul) and the liver (= seat of the emotions and life) may have been present already in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) (cp. also [Dondo](LanguageTable#cldf:584), [Totoli](LanguageTable#cldf:1084) _ate bula_ ‘lungs’, [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _ate ruaʔ_ ‘lungs’, with _ate_ < &ast;_qaCay_ ‘liver’) .

Examples include [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _vau_ ‘Blumea balsamifera (leaves called _lamud_ used for covering tubers while cooking)’, [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _báxo_ ‘tree suitable for the preparation of primitive beehives’, [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) _bagú_ ‘kind of tree, the bark of which may serve as a provisional cloth or as a mat to sleep on’, [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _bagu_ ‘small tree, prob. _Fagraea racemosa_’, [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _balu_, _falu_, _tulaŋ balu_ ‘tree sp.’, [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _baru_ ‘plant resembling the _kurri_ (ramie, or hemp plant) the flowers of which stick like burrs to the clothes’, [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) _waru_ ‘tree belonging to the willow family which yields a good timber’, [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) _varu_ ‘tree and gourd sp.’, [Buruese](LanguageTable#cldf:251) _bahu_ ‘a tree: _Shorea_ sp.’, [Buli](LanguageTable#cldf:249) _pai_ ‘tree sp.’, [Manam](LanguageTable#cldf:328) _paru_ ‘a tree: _Mangas Pid._ (leaf used for cigarettes)’, [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359) _valu_ ‘tree sp.’, ['Āre'āre](LanguageTable#cldf:18004) _haru_ ‘a shrub’, [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) _haru_ ‘tree sp.’, and [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _bau_ ‘tree with edible fruit and beautiful brownish-red wood, used to make canoes, boxes, etc.: _Sapotaceae_ sp.’.  



The value of this plant as a source of cordage is reflected linguistically in two very distinct ways in [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages: (1) In [Proto-Micronesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19079) the word for ‘hibiscus’ reflects [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_kulit_ ‘skin, bark’ + &ast;_baRu_, the name for the valuable bark having come to stand for the entire tree; (2) [Proto-Micronesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19079) &ast;_fau fau_ ‘tie, bind, lash’; [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _vau_ ‘tie, bind’, [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362) _fau_ ‘construct by tying, bind together, lash’, [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) _fau_ ‘bind, lash together’, [Kapingamarangi](LanguageTable#cldf:292) _hau_ ‘lash, tie, construct’, and similar verbs in other languages also appear to derive from &ast;_baRu_.  We thus see two linguistic changes motivated by the economic uses of this tree, the first a semantic change based on synecdoche, the second a semantic-syntactic change based on the habitual association of an activity and a material.",PMP,Canonical
25179,the Malayan sun bear: Ursus malayanus,dempwolff193438[];adelaar1992[],*baRuaŋ,"Also [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _baroaŋ_ ‘primitive, ape, bear (animal)’.  This cognate set is geographically more restricted than most cognate sets that are attributed to [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP).  Reflexes of &ast;_baRuaŋ_, &ast;_biRuaŋ_, however, are widespread in Borneo and are clearly native, as they have sometimes undergone extensive sound changes which have not affected loans.  This is particularly noticeable in languages that have strengthened non-phonemic transitional glides, as with [Long Glat (Modang)](LanguageTable#cldf:850) _wahaguŋ_ (where /_g_/ reflects the intervocalic glide that was phonetically present between the vowels &ast;_-ua-_, which then metathesized), [Kiput](LanguageTable#cldf:18958) (where /_f_/ reflects the similar glide), [Bintulu](LanguageTable#cldf:242) (where &ast;_R_ disappeared, and from intermediate &ast;_buaŋ_ the same transitional glide was strengthened to /_b_/ and the preceding &ast;_u_ centralized) and [Berawan (Long Terawan)](LanguageTable#cldf:19191) (where intervocalic &ast;_R_ became /_k_/, the first syllable was lost, and the strengthening of the phonetic glide and centralization of &ast;_u_ paralleled the development in [Kiput](LanguageTable#cldf:18958)).  Indeed, the cognation of [Bintulu](LanguageTable#cldf:242) _bebaŋ_ and particularly of [Berawan (Long Terawan)](LanguageTable#cldf:19191) _kebiŋ_ with e.g. [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _beruaŋ_ is far from obvious, but is borne out by careful study of the sound correspondences. 


[Dempwolff's (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) &ast;_ba(r)uaŋ_ can be disambiguated as containing &ast;_R_.  Of the four languages that he compared ([Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427), and [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285)), the first two have merged all vocalic oppositions in prepenultimate position, [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _baruaŋ_ differs in meaning and may not be cognate, and [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _beruaŋ_, like [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _baroaŋ_ and [Buginese](LanguageTable#cldf:239) _baruaŋ_, appears to be a Malay loanword.  His unambiguous reconstruction of first-syllable &ast;_a_ was thus apparently an illusion.  Both [Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243) and [Minangkabau](LanguageTable#cldf:337) preserve the contrast of &ast;_a_ and &ast;_i_ in prepenultimate position ([Adelaar 1992](Source#cldf:adelaar1992)), and these witnesses agree in indicating &ast;_i_.  The reflexes in [Murut (Paluan)](LanguageTable#cldf:917), [Kadazan Dusun](LanguageTable#cldf:287), and [Lun Dayeh](LanguageTable#cldf:19418), on the other hand, indicate &ast;_a_.  


Finally, the first appearance of this word must date from at least the entry of the ancestral population of present-day Austronesian speakers into Borneo (hence to approximately the period 2,000-1,500 B.C.).  It may, however, be considerably older.  The bear, generally designated by a reflex of &ast;_Cumay_, is also found in Taiwan, but is absent in the intervening Philippines.  In Southeast Asia it is found only on Borneo, the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra.  Since &ast;_Cumay_ and &ast;_baRuaŋ_, &ast;_biRuaŋ_ are not cognate, no certain inference can be made about a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) word for ‘bear’.  The distribution of word and referent in this case provides an instructive contrast with reflexes of &ast;_qaRem_ ‘pangolin’ (q.v.), where the animal has the same discontinuous distribution (Taiwan and Borneo), but the native names are cognate, thus requiring a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) reconstruction.",PWMP,Canonical

The latter is defined as ‘wijwater’ (holy water), and is cross-referenced with _laoe peŋoeras_.  Under _oeras_ Neumann gives _ŋoeras_ ‘purify (of weapons, etc.) with lemon juice’, _ŋoerasi_ ‘purify, by means of _laoe peŋoeras_, of evil influences which may attach to persons or things’.  The reference to the juice of citrus fruits as a medium of ritual purification in this gloss and less directly in the gloss for [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _basbás_ is strengthened by parallel practices among the Bagobo of Mindanao and among the Austroasiatic-speaking inhabitants of the Nicobar islands ([Blust 1981: fn. 23](Source#cldf:blust1981)).  


Based on the evidence available to date it appears that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_basbas_ referred to a ritual ablution which involved the sprinkling of water or citrus juice (or a mixture of the two) on the object for purification.  In language groups that have become more acculturated to world religions (as the Christian [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) and Moslem [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)) the original sense of this term has been reinterpreted in different ways.  There is no known evidence that the notion of ritual ablution was found in the [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) (as opposed to the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP)) term.

29849,"tree trunk, fallen tree, log; stem of a plant; body; corpse; self; bridge of the nose; most important or preeminent thing; main course of a river; mushroom or bracket fungus that grows on tree trunks or decaying logs",dempwolff193438[],*bataŋ,"[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_bataŋ_ ‘trunk, stalk, stick’, but the glosses in attested languages suggest a far richer and more nuanced set of meanings.  In its most literal sense [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_bataŋ_ evidently referred to the trunk of a tree, whether standing or fallen, or to the corresponding lighter structure in a woody or non-woody plant (the stem or stalk).  From this botanical sense the meaning ‘body’ was derived by extension to the world of animals, in much the same way that English refers to the main portion of the human body as the ‘trunk’.  Because of its shape the meaning ‘tree trunk’ apparently was also used as a numeral classifier for cylindrical objects, although contact influence from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326)cannot be ruled out as an explanation for the attested distribution of &ast;_bataŋ_ in this sense.  


Several additional meanings can be assigned to [Proto-Western Malayo-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) or to lower-order proto-languages.  Some of these may have been present in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP), but cannot be retrieved from the available lexicographical resources for [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CEMP) languages, which in general are less numerous and less detailed than sources for the demographically more important languages of western Indonesia and the Philippines.  These additional meanings include ‘corpse’, ‘bridge of the nose’, ‘most important or preeminent thing’, ‘main course of a river’, ‘mushroom or bracket fungus that grows on tree trunks or decaying logs’, and possibly ‘bridge’.  Rather than treating some or all of these meanings as evidence for homophonous bases, it seems clear that they all derive from the notion of ‘trunk’.  Just as &ast;_bataŋ_ ‘body’ represents an extension of a botanical structure to a living human or animal, so &ast;_bataŋ_ ‘corpse’ represents an extension of the notion ‘fallen tree, log’ to a dead human or animal.  


Similarly, the meaning ‘body’ was extended to the notion ‘self’, and the concrete meaning ‘trunk’ to the abstract sense ‘most important or preeminent thing’ (the central element in a tree being the trunk, from which the branches sprout).  Reflexes of &ast;_bataŋ_ ‘bridge of the nose’ are confined to languages of the southern Philippines, Borneo (including [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432)), and  [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) , but are consistent in comparing the ridge or upper line of the nose to a tree trunk (the literal sense of a log bridge across a river can be included if we are allowed to compare [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _wataŋan_ ‘tree trunk (as bridge)’, with reflexes of &ast;_bataŋ_ ‘bridge’ in several languages of the Lesser Sundas).  In the absence of further evidence the agreement of [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _bataŋ pinaŋ_ ‘a weaving model or design’ with [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _bataŋan_ ‘shape, figure, model’ cannot be be further clarified.



Perhaps the most striking metaphorical usage of &ast;_bataŋ_ is its application to the main course of a river, which can be seen as the ‘trunk’, from which the tributary ‘branches’ spring (although the directionality of movement is opposite in the two domains, since tributary streams flow  _into_ the ‘trunk’ rather than growing out from it).  Finally, a number of WMP reflexes of &ast;_bataŋ_ refer to mushrooms or other types of fungi, and where sufficient information is available these appear to be types of saprophytes that grow either on the trunks of living trees, or perhaps more commonly, on decaying logs.



By contrast with &ast;_bataŋ_, with which it is possible to associate a number of distinct but interrelated glosses, reflexes of &ast;_bataŋ-an_ are highly disparate.  For [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) it appears possible to posit &ast;_bataŋ-an_ ‘floor girders of a house’, but no gloss can be assigned to earlier forms of this affixed word.",PMP,Canonical

[Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _batu_ ‘numeral classifier for teeth’ and [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _batu_ ‘tooth (fig.)’ raises the possibility that this innovation may have involved a transfer of functions formerly covered by &ast;_buaq_ to reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_batu_ ‘numeral classifier for teeth’ that was lost in the great majority of attested languages and so cannot now be securely reconstructed.  



Other likely products of convergence are [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _bato-bato_ ‘grouper, fam.  _Serrranidae’_, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _ikan batu_ ‘sea bream:  _Proteracanthus sarissophorus_’, [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _fatu_ ‘a seafish’, and [Toqabaqita](LanguageTable#cldf:19197) _iqa fau_ ‘boxfish:  _Ostracion sebae_,’ the forms that refer to various types of amulets or talismans in  [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) and [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), and possibly the [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) and [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330) forms assigned to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_quzan batu_ ‘hail’.  On the other hand, constructions like &ast;_batu papan_  (lit. ‘plank stone’) are more difficult to account for as convergent developments, and it must be assumed that such stones were valued for some purpose, or else it would be difficult to explain why they were distinctively named.  



A number of languages in island Southeast Asia have borrowed [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _batu berani_ ‘magnet’; in many cases this is apparent from irregularities in the sound correspondences, as with [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _batu balániʔ_, [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226) _bató_ _balániʔ_, [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _batu_ _baláni_, [Mansaka](LanguageTable#cldf:825) _bato barani_, [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _batew barani_, [Tausug](LanguageTable#cldf:18831) _batu balani_, [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) _batu barani_  ‘lodestone, magnet’, but [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _batu bogani_ ‘magnet’ appears to be native.  I assume that this form is also a [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loan, but has been reshaped by the substitution of a native reflex of &ast;_baRani_.  



Many languages have also borrowed [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _batu_ in the meaning ‘milestone; mile’, for marking travel distances, as with [Mapun](LanguageTable#cldf:19176) _batu_ ‘kilometer; marker along the road for counting kilometers (made from cement or wood)’, [Lun Dayeh](LanguageTable#cldf:19418) _batuh_ ‘a mile’, [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) _batu_ ‘milestone; mile’



It is likely that various types of stone (limestone, pumice, etc.) were designated by [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_batu_ plus a qualifying term, but the details of such constructions cannot be reconstructed on the basis of currently available data.



There are also scattered references to the meaning ‘slave’ in association with an apparent reflex of &ast;_batu_, as with [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _batu ni ruma_ (lit. ‘stone of the house’) ‘a slave that has been in the house since the time of one’s grandfather (coarse expression)’, [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) _batu-m-balane_ ‘slaves’ and [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _watua_ ‘slave’.

Since it is currently limited to two witnesses that support the reconstructed meaning it could be a product of convergence.

The alternative view --- that &ast;_bawaŋ_ was found in [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) in the meaning posited here --- could be revolutionary, since it would imply that terraced pondfields were already used by the Proto-Philippine language community for agricultural purposes, an interpretation which is totally inconsistent with the view of [Keesing (1962)](Source#cldf:keesing1962), and one that suggests an earlier development even than that proposed by [Reid (1994)](bib-Reid).

The known distribution of this cognate set clearly is due in part to borrowing from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326). In particular, it is striking how reflexes south of the Philippines invariably have or reflect an earlier _–r_.  However, borrowing cannot be the explanation for the entire set of related forms since _–d_ in Philippine languages would not be expected from a [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loanword with a final liquid, nor would final /_r_/ in most languages of western Indonesia be expected from a loanword with final /_d_/.

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) glossed &ast;_beli_ ‘to buy’ (‘Kaufen’), and indeed this is the attested gloss in the great majority of reflexes.  Buying, however, is an activity which involves the acquisition of objects through a common medium of exchange -- i.e. some form of money.  There is no known evidence of any kind that speakers of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) (circa 3,000 BC) were familiar with a money economy; moreover, various reflexes of &ast;_beli_ both in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) and in [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) languages indicate that this item referred in particular to the ‘brideprice’. Since brideprice is a set of economic arrangements between the families or descent groups involved in a marriage, the gloss ‘to buy’ for this form is best seen as an imposition upon an earlier economic order based on exchange by a later one based on purchase.  


Moreover, since there is good reason to believe that the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) socio-political order was based on matrilateral cross-cousin marriage, or asymmetric exchange ([Blust 1980a](Source#cldf:blust1980), [Blust 1993](Source#cldf:blust1993)), it appears likely that &ast;_beli_ referred in particular to that category of ‘masculine’ goods which counter-circulated with the circulation of women in the formation of marriage-based alliances.  The generalization of a meaning ‘marriage prestations’ to that of purchase through a common medium of exchange would have followed naturally with the adoption of a money economy, hence the widespread semantic drift.  Under this interpretation the gloss of Proto-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian &ast;_poli_ would not have differed significantly from that of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_beli_, although there is little direct evidence that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) asymmetric exchange survived in Proto-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, or that Proto-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian &ast;_poli_ referred to marriage prestations.",PAN,Canonical

Taken at face value the [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) and [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) forms support a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) reconstruction with mid-front penultimate vowel.  However, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) as reconstructed to date has only four vowels: &ast;_i_, &ast;_u_, &ast;_e_ (schwa), &ast;_a_.  Since the schwa normally became [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) /_a_/ in the penult, and [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_o_ in all positions, it cannot have been the penultimate vowel in this form, leaving us to conclude that the similarity of the [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) and [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) words in both shape and meaning is a particularly striking coincidence.  Finally, the semantic evolution of this form from ‘coconut husk’ to ‘rubbish’ and even ‘excrement’ seems to have followed a natural path determined by the almost daily use of coconuts: the nut cannot be used for meat or milk unless the husk is first removed, and this is most commonly discarded as refuse, since only a small percentage of the many husks that are removed would be needed for cordage and the like.",POC,Canonical

This inference runs against the observation that reflexes of &ast;_beNbeN_ are found in at least some members of every primary branch of Austronesian that is represented in Taiwan (Atayalic, Northwest Formosan, Western Plains, [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250), Tsouic, [Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:397), [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386), [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370), East Formosan), making this a far stronger candidate.



It must be kept in mind that the Spanish were present in the Taipei basis from 1626-1642, and left loanwords such as _baka_ ‘cow’ (< Span. _vaca_) and _paskua_ ‘New Year’s Day’ (< Span. _Pascua_ ‘Easter’) in [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293). Since the Spanish came to Taiwan from Manila and almost certainly brought Filipinos with them, the typical Malayo-Polynesian words for ‘banana’ in [Basai](LanguageTable#cldf:19171) and [Trobiawan](LanguageTable#cldf:19209) probably are best attributed to borrowing of a form like [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920) _punti_ ‘banana’.  Alternatively (since reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_punti_ are rare in the Philippines, and absent from [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423)), it is conceivable that both &ast;_beNbeN_ and &ast;_puti_ were found in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN), the first as a generic term for _Musa_ spp. and the second as the designation for a particular banana species or variety that expanded its field of reference and acquired a preconsonantal medial nasal in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP). As with other reduplicated monosyllables, it is assumed that the medial consonant cluster in this word was broken up by schwa epenthesis in the separate histories of several Formosan languages, a hypothesis that is further supported by the occurrence of a word-final schwa in [Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:397) and the Tsouic languages [Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680) and [Saaroa](LanguageTable#cldf:974), which do not permit unambiguous final consonants.",PAN,Canonical

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_beRas_ ‘husked rice’.  Although the great majority of reflexes specify ‘husked rice’ as the referent of this term, a few give ‘unhusked rice’ ([Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282), [Hiligaynon](LanguageTable#cldf:623)).  This difference probably is more apparent than real, given the potential ambiguity in the English term ‘unhusked’ (1. negative of ‘husked’, 2. past of ‘unhusk’).  What is clear is that &ast;_beRas_ referred to rice that has been harvested but not yet cooked, evidently without respect to whether it has been pounded to remove the husk.  However, since harvested rice would remain unhusked for a very short time prior to storage, and would remain in storage prior to cooking for a considerably longer period, it is reasonable to suppose that the more common referent of &ast;_beRas_ would be rice in the latter state. 


Reflexes in several widely separated [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages support the reconstruction of additional meanings, including (1) ‘fruit; fruitful’ ([Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647), [Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246), [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427), [Dairi-Pakpak Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18147)), (2) ‘seed, pit’ ([Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816)), (3) ‘pimples that resemble rice grains’ -- a term that apparently referred to an affliction of pigs ([Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252), [Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)), (4) ‘hail’ ([Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647), [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427)), and probably (5) ‘testicles’ ([Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), and [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) _búgas_ ‘scrotum’ next to _bugás_ ‘husked rice’, with accent shift to distinguish meanings that originated as one, but subsequently required separation).

Three general morphological observations are of some interest in connection with this form: (1) The analysis of [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _veŋin_, [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _borŋin_ and similar forms with _-n_ remains unclear.  If &ast;_-n_ was a suffix it evidently was unique or very rare, and its function obscure (if from &ast;_beRŋi-en_, the suffixal vowel has irregularly dropped). Alternatively, we could posit a doublet, but this appears unsatisfactory in view of the likelihood that &ast;_beRŋi_ appeared in a number of different expressions, some of which almost certainly involved affixation, (2) evidence from both [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) and [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages suggests that this word sometimes occurred with the 3sg possessive suffix: [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) _&ast;beRŋi-ni-a_, [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_poŋi-ña_.  [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_poŋi_ thus took the marking for ‘inalienable’ possession (like body parts, kin terms, the words for ‘name’, ‘shadow/soul’ and the like).  (3) internal Polynesian evidence suggests that the irregular change observed in PPn &ast;_pō_ ‘night’ probably resulted by back-formation from &ast;_poŋi-a_ ‘be overcome by night’ (to &ast;&ast;_po-ŋia_, with automatic moraic extension of the new monosyllabic content word &ast;&ast;_po_ to &ast;&ast;_pō_).  If so, [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330) _pōŋi-a_ ‘be overtaken by night, benighted’ represents an analogical extension of the lengthened vowel to a morphological context in which it did not originally occur.  


With regard to meaning, it is clear from usages in both [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) and [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages that this term had multiple functions.  In addition to designating ‘night’ (opposite of day), &ast;_beRŋi_ marked the 24-hour unit used in counting ‘days’ (hence ‘how many days?’, ‘three days ago’, ‘three days hence’, etc.), and evidently figured in the expression for ‘tomorrow’ (‘day after tomorrow’, etc.; ‘yesterday’, however, was expressed with &ast;_ñeRab_ or its doublet _ñiRab_).  As noted by [Pawley (1979)](bib-Pawley), [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_poŋi_ probably was used in conjunction with &ast;_panua_ in some time expressions.  Finally, [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _sa baŋgí_ ‘at night, in the evening’, [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _sa beŋi_ ‘all night long, one whole night’ are assumed to reflect different proclitic elements (&ast;_sa_ ‘locative’ vs. the clitic form of &ast;_esa_ ‘one’).",PMP,Canonical

One of the basic pieces of lexical evidence for early Austronesian voyaging, &ast;_beRsay_ is phonologically notable in being one of a small set of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) lexical items that contains preconsonantal &ast;_R_. Although the medial cluster was lost in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) it clearly was retained not only in Central Philippine languages and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP)), but also in at least two languages of extreme northeast Indonesia, notably [Arguni](LanguageTable#cldf:483) ([CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP)?) and [Numfor](LanguageTable#cldf:364) ([South Halmahera-West New Guinea](LanguageTable#cldf:SHWNG)).  Due to the number of sometimes highly specific environments governing conditioned changes in [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) it is not always easy to determine the regularity of a change in this language.  I assume that [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _besós_ reflects &ast;_beRsay_, with (1) a medial epenthetic shwa which, being penultimate, secondarily acquired the stress (&ast;_beRésay_), and (2) a change &ast;_s_ to _s_ (for anticipated &ast;&ast;_t_) which was either conditioned by the presence of a preceding _s_, or which shows a sporadic assimilation to it.",PMP,Canonical

I take ‘WZH’ to be the unmarked meaning of ‘the husband of one's sister-in-law’ (reflecting a male point of view), although ‘HZH’ is also available.

Despite the perfect formal and semantic agreement of the [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) and [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) forms this comparison remains problematic, since [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _bilás_ is ambiguous for &ast;_bilas_ or &ast;_biras_, and other Philippine witnesses point clearly to the first alternative, which is phonologically incompatible with [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _biras_.

The known [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) evidence for &ast;_biRaq_ in the meaning ‘Alocasia macrorrhiza’ is confined to two dialects of [Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:397).  Far better attested in Taiwan are reflexes of a form with the same shape meaning ‘leaf’.  Although it is not immediately obvious that the two sets are connected, [Paul J-K Li (p.c.)](bib-Paul)  informs me that the exceptionally large, smooth leaves of _Alocasia_ were commonly used in the past as food wrappers among both aboriginal peoples and Minnan Chinese.  If we are dealing with a single cognate set, then, the original specific reference to _Alocasia_ appears to have been all but completely lost in most [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) languages; if ‘leaf wrapper’ was part of the gloss of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_biRaq_ it evidently was completely lost in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP).  The reflexes in [Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569), [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) and ['Āre'āre](LanguageTable#cldf:18004) indicate that this visually striking plant also had medicinal uses.

The [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394) and Polynesian reflexes of &ast;_bituqen_ show a sporadic lowering of the first vowel and what appears to be regressive assimilation of the last vowel (expected &ast;&ast;_o_), almost certainly as the result of a single innovation. Other types of irregularities appear in [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) _hisiu_ ‘star’, and in the Micronesian reflexes cited here, and it is possible that the [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) reflex of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_bituqen_ was &ast;_pituqun_ rather than &ast;_pituqon_.  [Dahl (1976)](Source#cldf:dahl1976) interprets the unexpected last vowel of [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _vitjuqan_ as evidence that &ast;_bituqen_ contained a base morpheme &ast;_bituq_ which could be suffixed either with &ast;_-an_ or &ast;_-en_.  This argument would be considerably enhanced if at least some comparative evidence were presented for a simple base &ast;_bituq_, but such evidence has not been forthcoming.  Moreover, the proposal that a base meaning ‘star’ could be suffixed with &ast;_-an_ or &ast;_-en_ is itself open to question.  In view of these observations I prefer to treat the [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) form as exhibiting an unexplained irregularity.",PAN,Canonical

Given the probable reflex of &ast;_buaq_ in [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _voa-lavo_ ‘species of rat’ it is likely that the otherwise unexplained initial syllable of [Melanau (Mukah)](LanguageTable#cldf:349) _belabaw_ ‘rat’ is a phonologically reduced form of &ast;_buaq_; if so the similar syllable in _belaŋaw_ ‘housefly’ (&ast;_laŋaw_) and _belawaʔ_ ‘spider’ (&ast;_lawaq_) presumably is to be explained in the same way.  


[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_buaq_ is one of the most fundamental Austronesian comparisons, and its denotation clearly encompassed the notion ‘fruit’, but its precise meaning remains poorly defined.  Although [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) reflexes point to the meaning ‘fruit’, in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) the general reference to ‘fruit’ appears to have been signaled by &ast;_buaq ni kahiw_ (&ast;_buaq_ of a tree). At the same time various other affixed, compounded or reduplicated forms of &ast;_buaq_ had different referents, thus pointing to a more abstract sense for &ast;_buaq_ than ‘fruit’.  Distributional evidence favors the association of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_buaq_ alone or in composition with at least the following glosses: 


1. fruit (almost universal), 2. areca palm and nut (almost universal from the northern Philippines to the Southeast Solomons), 3. grain ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP)), 4. berry ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)), 5. seed ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)), 6. nut ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)), 7. endosperm of a sprouting coconut ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)), 8. kidney ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)), 9. heart ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)), 10. finger ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP)), 11. calf of the leg ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)), 12. testicle ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)), 13. various insects ([Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299), [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414)), 14. scar tissue ([Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816)), 15. roe ([Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) ), 16.  bud ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)), 17. flower/blossom ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)), 18. to bear fruit ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)), 19. words, speech or songs ([Rhade](LanguageTable#cldf:956), [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276)?, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404), [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060), [Nukuoro](LanguageTable#cldf:363), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390), [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620)), 20. meaning, contents of discussion ([Dairi-Pakpak Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18147), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816)).  In addition to these glosses several others can be assocated with [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) &ast;_buaq_, including 21. buttock ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947)), 22. Adam's apple ([Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404)), 23. nipple of the breast ([Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294), [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), [Tontemboan](LanguageTable#cldf:19052)), 24. button ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404)), 25. marble ([Melanau (Mukah)](LanguageTable#cldf:349), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361)) and 26. some still undefined connection with tattooing ([Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294), [Mentawai](LanguageTable#cldf:335), possibly [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276)).  



The following points are noteworthy: 



1) [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_buaq_ formed the head of many head-attribute constructions which functioned as the names of particular fruits (&ast;_buaq kuluR_ ‘breadfruit’, &ast;_buaq niuR_ ‘coconut’, &ast;_buaq pahuq_ ‘mango’, &ast;_buaq punti_ ‘banana’, etc.). It is likely that the same was true of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN), although the available [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) evidence is scanty, 



2) [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_buaq_ almost certainly functioned in addition as a numeral classifier which applied to roundish or fruit-like objects (the [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) and [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391) usages evidently are innovative).  This inference is supported by evidence from a number of [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages, including [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), [Rhade](LanguageTable#cldf:956), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), and [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), a number of [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) languages, including [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678), [Hawu](LanguageTable#cldf:405), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060), [Asilulu](LanguageTable#cldf:18016) (?), [Alune](LanguageTable#cldf:471) and [Kamarian](LanguageTable#cldf:288), and a number of [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages, including [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485), [Woleaian](LanguageTable#cldf:443), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390), [Nukuoro](LanguageTable#cldf:363) and [Tuvaluan](LanguageTable#cldf:19417) (also see [Pawley 1972:35-36](Source#cldf:pawley1972)).  
The referents of &ast;_buaq_ as a numeral classifier included houses ([Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678)), villages ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Kamarian](LanguageTable#cldf:288)), beads ([Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289), [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060), [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620)), stones ([Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485)), eggs ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Rhade](LanguageTable#cldf:956), [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Hawu](LanguageTable#cldf:405), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060), [Alune](LanguageTable#cldf:471), [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390)), and mountains ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Kamarian](LanguageTable#cldf:288)).  It is noteworthy that other candidates for numeral classifiers are yet to be identified, placing the weight of the inference that classifiers were used in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) entirely on &ast;_buaq_, 



3) most [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) and [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) reflexes support an inference that the meanings ‘fruit’ and ‘areca nut’ were associated with the same morpheme, but the [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) evidence suggests that there were two homophonous morphemes.  I assume that one morpheme expressed both meanings, but that in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) these meanings become disassociated and connected respectively with oral and nasal grade reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_buaq_ ([POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_puaq_ ‘fruit’, &ast;_mpuaq_ ‘betel nut’).  One [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) language (Tetum) also has distinct phonological reflexes for each meaning, but this observation is taken to be unrelated to the facts in [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages, 



4) the use of a reflex of &ast;_buaq_ as a classifier for bullets is fairly widespread ([Rhade](LanguageTable#cldf:956), [Dairi-Pakpak Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18147), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390)) and is, of course, a product of convergent semantic development. Likewise, despite the accessibility of the referent in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) times, distributional evidence suggests that the meaning ‘endosperm of a sprouting coconut’ in association with a reflex of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_buaq_ was independently innovated in PGreater Central Philippine  and [Bwaidoga/Bwaidoka](LanguageTable#cldf:19016).",PAN,Canonical

 Reflexes of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_bubu_ are among the most persistent words which refer to a cultural artefact.  The &ast;_bubu_ trap shows small variations in form and function in its wide distribution from Taiwan to Madagascar to Fiji and indeed, several variants are often found in individual cultures.  The basic form, however, is that of a wickerwork basket made of bamboo, about one meter long and roughly conical in shape, with a smaller conical entrance of converging bamboo splints (illustrated, e.g. in [Fey 1986:98](Source#cldf:fey1986)).  Within the ethnographic present such traps were generally placed in the mouths of rivers or in the sea near the shore, baited and sometimes weighted with stones to keep them below water and prevent them from drifting.  Fish or eels which entered to take the bait were able to slip through the converging splints of the trap mouth, but could not exit.  Larger and structurally more complex varieties contained two or more compartments, each entered in the same way through successively more restrictive openings which culminated in a cul-de-sac ([PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) &ast;_bunuq-an_) from which the fish were ultimately collected.  


Traps of the same general type were also traditionally used in other parts of the world, including west Africa, western Europe, and among various Eskimo groups.  This comparison provides evidence for an important fishing implement which must have been used by speakers of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) on Taiwan, and subsequently carried by speakers of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) and its descendants throughout island Southeast Asia (including Madagascar) and the Pacific.

Although [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_bubuŋ_ apparently was a partial reduplication, in a few scattered languages ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)) it has been reinterpreted as a full reduplication, perhaps through contamination with &ast;_buŋbuŋ_ ‘swell up, rise’.  [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) appears to have retained a reflex only of the suffixed form (&ast;_pupuŋan_), and like many other trisyllabic words which contained a reduplicated first syllable this form sometimes lost the initial syllable in conformity with a general disyllabic canonical target ([Blust 1977a](Source#cldf:blust1977)). In some languages of the _Southeast Solomons_  the resulting form came to be obligatorily possessed, as is typical of many part-to-whole relationships, thereby acquiring an optional or obligatory 3sg. suffix _-na_.  It is clear that by at least [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) times houses were made with with a central ridgepole, producing a gabled roof.  Whether &ast;_bubuŋ_ referred to the ridge of the roof as a general structural feature, or specifically to the ridgepole (or both) is unclear, although the latter may have been specified as &ast;_kahiw ni bubuŋ_ (cf. e.g. [Buli](LanguageTable#cldf:249) _pupuŋ-an ni ai_).  Similarly, although both &ast;_bubuŋ_ and &ast;_bubuŋ-an_ are widely reflected, it is unknown how (or if) they differed in meaning, despite some suggestive semantic distinctions such as that in [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) between _búbuŋ_ ‘outside roof ridge’ and _ambubúŋ-an_ ‘inside roof ridge’.  



As a general rule reflexes of &ast;_bubuŋ_ appear to refer more often to the ridge of the roof, and reflexes of &ast;_bubuŋ-an_ to the roof as a whole (lit. ‘place of the ridge’).  Although this correlation is very imperfect it receives some support from the fact that no other monosememic term appears to be available for ‘roof’, the only other candidate (&ast;_qatep_) meaning both ‘roof’ and ‘thatch’.  As with &ast;_qatep_, &ast;_bubuŋ_ evidently referred both to the ridge of the roof and to the thatch that covered it (reflexes in several Philippine languages, [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391) and [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394)), and in this respect it differs sharply from &ast;_bubuŋ-an_, reflexes of which rarely if ever specify the thatch as opposed to the ridge of the roof, or the roof as a whole.  In addition it appears that &ast;_bubuŋ_ was used for the decks of boats ([Mentawai](LanguageTable#cldf:335), [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434)) and for natural ridges on hills or mountains (several languages of Mindanao, [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Yamdena](LanguageTable#cldf:1130), [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359), [Ulawa](LanguageTable#cldf:1095)).",PMP,Canonical

A lexically encoded distinction between blindness in one eye and blindness in both eyes is common to a number of Austronesian languages, and can be reconstructed for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) (as &ast;_picek_, &ast;_buta_ respectively).

Although evidence for the unaffixed base is scanty, it seems clear that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) distinguished &ast;_puput_ and &ast;_puput-i_.  In accordance with a widespread drift toward a disyllabic canonical target in [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages which incidentally produced a correlation between reduplication and intransitivity ([Blust 1977a](Source#cldf:blust1977)), reflexes of &ast;_puput-i_ have often lost the initial syllable by haplology.  Once this change occurred the same canonical pressure produced a tendency to reinterpret the suffix as part of the base, allowing further suffixation on top of the morphologically incorporated &ast;_-i_ in [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) and the Polynesian languages.  By this point the surviving remnants of the unreduced base were reinterpreted as partial reduplications (e.g. [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620) _huhuki_, cited by [Pukui and Elbert (1971)](bib-Pukui) as a reduplication of _huki_, whereas historically the latter actually is a reduction of the former).

Although &ast;_buCuq_ is often reflected in the meaning ‘penis’, it is clear that this meaning was represented by [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_qutiN_.  Both [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) and non-[Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.)  witnesses agree in supporting &ast;_buCuq_ ‘testicles’, but two observations suggest that this semantic inference may be incomplete.  


First, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_qateluR_, &ast;_qiteluR_ evidently meant both ‘egg’ and ‘testicle’.  


Second, an affixed form of [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) &ast;_butuq_ apparently also meant ‘to castrate animals’.  


With regard to the first observation it is possible that &ast;_qateluR_, &ast;_qiteluR_ differed from &ast;_butuq_ only in being more figurative.  However, reflexes of the latter term are often noted as vulgar or otherwise inappropriate to humans.  Together with references to castration, then, this observation suggests that &ast;_butuq_ referred primarily or exclusively to the testicles of animals, and only jokularly or crudely to those of humans.  Since comparative evidence supporting such a distinction is still lacking in the [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) languages, [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_buCuq_ must be reconstructed with the meaning ‘testicles (of both humans and animals)’.  It follows that a lexical differentiation arose in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) when &ast;_qateluR_, &ast;_qiteluR_ ‘egg’ was extended to include the meaning ‘testicles (of humans)’, leaving [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_butuq_ to cover a residual semantic category which was considered marked in relation to human beings.",PAN,Canonical

It is possible that some of the terms which I have assigned to different etyma of the shape &ast;_buat_ or &ast;_buhat_ are actually cognate.  The network of plausible semantic connections for forms that reflect etyma of these shapes is extraordinarily complex, including (probably among other still undiscovered types) the following range of meanings: harvest fruits, ceremony at planting, do, make, create, perform, to work, deed, thing, creation, gossip, behavior/conduct, performance, work, because/on account of, through the action of, need/use, necessary, for (benefactive), stand up, arise, emerge, begin, carry, cargo, take something, take a wife.  



In using such material for semantic reconstruction one is confronted with logical relations similar to those found in dialect chaining: either the whole complex is treated as a unit with the unwanted consequence that the extremities appear to be highly distinct or even unrelated, or else more-or-less arbitrary divisions are made in the chain of glosses with the unwanted consequence that various etyma of the same shape share a partial semantic similarity (cf. the supporting evidence for &ast;_b-in-uhat-an_ under &ast;_buhat_₂, which includes material semantically more appropriate to &ast;_buhat_₃).  Even if there was a single highly polysemous [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) term &ast;_buhat_, lexicographers of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) almost certainly would have differed in how many dictionary entries they recognized, just as lexicographers of its descendants differ in the grouping of homophonous terms, (e.g. for [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) [Wolff (1972)](Source#cldf:wolff1972) includes _búhat_ ‘do something, work’ and ‘ceremony of offering something cooked with no salt to spirits to insure harvest’ under a single entry, but assigns _búhat_ ‘lift’ to another, whereas the Binukid dictionary of [Post and Gardner (1992)](bib-Post) includes _buhat_ ‘deed, act; to do, make (something), perform’ and _ka-buhat_ ‘to change, turn, transform’ under a single entry, but contrarily assigns _buhat_ ‘appease spirit deities in a rite which involves prayers, offerings of betel nut, etc., and the slaughter of pigs and chickens’ to another.

The reconstruction of last-syllable schwa in this form is supported by [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) (Central dialect as recorded by [Fey 1986](Source#cldf:fey1986), but not the material cited by Tsuchida) and by all _Cordilleran_ witnesses.  A few languages, including [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) and [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) show sporadic assimilation of the second vowel to the first; others, including [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386), [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370), and [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), show the fusion of schwa with an adjacent vowel common to the historical phonology of many Austronesian languages. 


The more limited cognate set cited by Tsuchida does not permit a precise semantic reconstruction, and such misleading and inaccurate glosses as ‘marmot’ and ‘lemur’ (animals which do not occur in Southeast Asia) in some of the additional sources cited here contribute little to determining the referent of this term.  However, the agreement of [Mansaka](LanguageTable#cldf:825) _boot_ and [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) _buut_ with [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) glosses clearly supports an inference that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_buhet_ meant ‘squirrel’ (probably excluding ‘flying squirrel’, which is lexically distinguished in most [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) languages), and so adds one more member to the inventory of true placental mammals that can be lexically inferred as denizens of the Austronesian homeland ([Blust 1982a](Source#cldf:blust1982)).",PAN,Canonical

Given the evidence that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_buaq_ ‘fruit’ ceased to function as a generic marker for fruits, and that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_buŋa_ ‘flower’ underwent a semantic shift to cover the earlier referent of &ast;_buaq_, there is a high probability that &ast;_budak_ was a [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) innovation in the meaning ‘flower’.  All known referents except [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) _buraʔ_ are consistent with this interpretation, and the interpretation itself is consistent with the evidence supporting all three reconstructions.  For this reason I assume that [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) _buraʔ_ is a loan from one of the languages of northern Sulawesi. As evidence that such a basic term can be borrowed we need only consider the forms cited in this note for [Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569), [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291), [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920), [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) and [Palawan Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:247), all of which appear to be [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) loans, and many of the forms from Mindanao, which appear to be borrowed from [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) or some other Bisayan source.  Indeed, a comparable situation is seen in western Indonesia, where native terms are often used to refer to the blossoms of fructifying plants, while [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _buŋa_ has been borrowed as a term for flowers in the (modern) ornamental or decorative sense.",PWMP,Canonical

The fundamental referent of &ast;_bujeq_ clearly was the effervescent surface of liquids (foam, bubbles).

All [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages reflect &ast;_puke_ rather than &ast;_puka_, with an idiosyncratic change.  The semantic evolution of &ast;_buka_ suggests that although this term is the translation equivalent of English ‘open’ it differed conceptually in at least one important respect.  The unmarked sense of ‘to open’ in English, as in most Indo-European  languages, involves the removal or setting aside of a structure which blocks access into a three-dimensional bounded space (e.g. the doorway or window of a house, the opening of a box or other container, the mouth).  


By contrast, reflexes of &ast;_buka_ in Austronesian languages often mean ‘open’ in the sense of ‘uncover’, ‘expose’ or ‘disclose’.  This semantic disconformity is reminiscent of the difference of ‘conceptual focus’ seen in comparing location terms such as ‘in, inside’ in Indo-European  and Austronesian languages ([Blust 1997](Source#cldf:blust1997)), where the former make implicit reference to a three-dimensional bounded space, and the latter to a planar surface. Thus in Austronesian languages one ‘opens’ (unfurls) a flag, one ‘opens’ (removes) one's clothing, or one ‘opens’ (uncovers) an earth oven, and the act of opening primarily makes something come into view or become visible to the observer rather than allowing access into a three-dimensional bounded space for an active agent.  The extension of this term to the use of switches (for electric lights) and the like follows paths of change that are also found outside Austronesian (e.g. in Chinese ).",PMP,Canonical

Oceanic reflexes suggest that the name was transferred to other wood-eating insects, including perhaps the mason wasp and various beetles. Evidently by [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) times the same term was applied to tooth decay, although it is unclear whether this extension was based on simple observation of similarity in the external results, or on a belief in similar underlying causes (glosses in [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647), [Itawis](LanguageTable#cldf:648), [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), and [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359)).

This item probably contains the root &ast;[-ku(q)](root-acd-r_k.htm#-ku(q)) ‘bend, curve’. While [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_siku_ (with the same root) is the only secure candidate for ‘elbow’, &ast;_buku_ is a poor competitor with &ast;_tuSud_ ‘knee’, a form that is widely reflected in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Indonesia. This fact suggests that &ast;_buku_ ‘knee’ is historically secondary, and may have arisen in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) as a stylistic variant of the ordinary word for ‘knee’. For a parallel development with the same root cf. [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) _deku_ ‘knee’, and for a parallel with a different but formally similar root &ast;[-kuŋ](root-acd-r_k.htm#-kuŋ) ‘bend, curve’, cf. [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _dekuŋ_ ‘knee’ (lit. ‘bending part’).



The basic sense of &ast;_buku_ appears to have been that of a joint or node, as in cane-like grasses or the human body.  Since the joints of the human body are often associated with swellings or subcutaneous protrusions references to the latter commonly appear as a secondary semantic component of this term, one which apparently has led in some languages to contamination with reflexes of &ast;_buŋkul_ ‘swelling, lump or bump under the skin’.  The somewhat puzzling agreement of [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _buku-búku_, [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _voho_ and the phonologically irregular [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) form _boko_ in pointing to the meaning ‘back’ may arise from the back having been conceived as the preeminent locus of joint-like articulations (the length of the spinal column). In the sense of a swelling or lump-like object it is clear that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_buku_ also referred to gnarls on trees and to knots in string or rope.  The widespread practice of tying knots in a cord to keep track of the passage of days leading up to some designated event ([Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299), [Penan](LanguageTable#cldf:18658), [Tontemboan](LanguageTable#cldf:19052), [Eddystone/Mandegusu](LanguageTable#cldf:261)) must be assumed to have a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) antiquity and is, of course, paralleled in other parts of the world (e.g. the Inca _quipu_).  




Finally, as a more abstract extension of the physical notion of articulation, reflexes of &ast;_buku_ refer to discrete units of language or discourse both in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) ([Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427), [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235)) and in [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) ([Kapingamarangi](LanguageTable#cldf:292)).",PMP,Canonical

As suggested by variations in the form of the name the distribution of the _bulalákaw_ belief may in part be a product of borrowing, but its genealogy probably extends to [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh).  Although most of the known evidence from Mindanao identifies the &ast;_bulalakaw_ with the spirits of lakes and rivers, the older association appears to have been with the spirits of meteors or shooting stars.

This word may be connected ultimately with [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_bulan_ ‘moon’ through a reduplication process which created nouns from a base X meaning ‘X-like’ or ‘similar in appearance to X’.

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_bulaN_ is one of the more widely reflected forms in Austronesian languages, particularly in island Southeast Asia.  Its primary sense clearly was ‘moon, lunar month’, but alone, affixed, or in collocation it also referred to the menstrual cycle.  Other notions which are encoded by a reflex of &ast;_bulaN_ and which probably involve universal tendencies in lexical semantics are: 1. the use of ‘months’ to refer in some way to the duration of a pregnancy ([Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331), [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235) and [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372)), and 2. the association of phases of the moon with mental or emotional instability or otherwise unpredictable behavior.  Many Austronesian languages name the phases of the moon, and/or the months of the year with a reflex of &ast;_bulaN_, but specific morphologically complex forms do not appear to be inferrable from the available evidence.  



Finally, generalized semantic agreements such as that in e.g. [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _sinam-búlan_ ‘central part of the bottom of a basket’, [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) _hura_ ‘circular bottom edge of a bowl’ probably are convergent, but the more specific agreement in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _bulan baju_ ‘crescentic collar piece’, [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) _hura_ ‘the round pearl shell disk of a chief, representing the full moon’ is more likely to continue a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) usage.",PAN,Canonical
25666,artificial cockspur; bind on an artificial cockspur,,*bulaŋ,"Also [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _olaŋ_ ‘raise the hand ready to strike’.  Although this comparison provides prima facie evidence for the presence of cockfighting in [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) society (circa 1500-2000 BC), it must be treated with caution.  First, the use of artificial cockspurs implies the use of metals, most likely iron, for utilitarian purposes at least a millennium earlier than the oldest archaeological evidence for iron artefacts in island Southeast Asia.  Second, although the basic sense of this term in the Philippines and western Borneo is ‘cockfight’ or ‘metal cockspur’, in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and some other languages of western Indonesia the basic sense of the term is not ‘metal cockspur’, but rather ‘to bind one object to another by winding around’, with special reference to metal cockspurs.  


Cockfighting is a central male social theme of many of the traditional cultures of Indonesia and the Philippines, but its antiquity in the Austronesian world remains obscure.  The practice has never been reported from any of the aboriginal peoples of Taiwan, and although the cock evidently was a component of the Austronesian settlement of the Pacific, cockfighting was not.  It is likely that the practice of cockfighting originated only after the use of iron for utilitarian purposes became common in the Austronesian world, since the manufacture of metal cockspurs evidently was essential to produce lethal (and hence for betting purposes, decisive) results.  The earliest archaeological evidence for ironworking technology in the Austronesian world dates from western Indonesia after 500 BC ([Bellwood 1997 [1985]:272](bib-Bellwood)); a plausible scenario, then, is that cockfighting was innovated in western Indonesia some 2000-2500 years ago and spread rapidly into the Philippines and eastern Indonesia.  The present linguistic comparison is assumed to reflect a historically secondary semantic elaboration of an etymon which originally had the more general sense ‘to bind one object to another’.  For convenience it is labeled as [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP), but the meaning, and perhaps the form itself evidently date from a later period.",PWMP,Canonical

This highly contentious etymology presents several problems.  First, the forms in [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), between northern Sulawesi and the Philippines, and in [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) and [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391) of western Flores in the Lesser Sundas appear to be borrowed from [Buginese](LanguageTable#cldf:239) or [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325).  Moreover, as a result of the Spanish presence in northern Taiwan (1626-1642) several loanwords from Spanish and from Philippine languages entered [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293), and it is possible that _berawan_ is one of these.  Second, evidence from both Philippine languages and [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) suggests that &ast;_bulaw-an_ is derived by affixation from a stem that did not mean ‘gold’. Third, [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _ma-bulaw_ ‘ripe (of fruits, vegetables, grains), golden, yellow-orange’ is clearly related, but cannot be native, since &ast;_b_ normally > _f_.  It probably is a loanword from [Bunun (Northern)](LanguageTable#cldf:563), although current lexicographic resources for [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) do not allow us to determine this with certainty, and no attested [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) dialect preserves &ast;l as a liquid. However, since a reflex of &ast;_bulaw-an_ is also attested in Taiwan ([Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _berawan_ ‘gold’), it appears likely that this form was found in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN).




The complete absence of the simple stem in most languages that contain a reflex of &ast;_bulaw-an_ suggests that the latter is a loanword, borrowed in isolation from the morphological paradigm in which it was created.  On the other hand, a number of the forms cited here have undergone regular sound changes, or distinctive semantic changes, and do not appear to be recent loans ([Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _belawan_, [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _wuyawa_, [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _bulaan_, various forms in the central Moluccas).  Also, it is possible that &ast;_bulawan_ was a trisyllabic stem which was reanalyzed as containing the suffix &ast;_-an_ (but if so it is necessary to hypothesize convergent reanalyses in various Philippine languages and in [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577).  



The matter thus remains in limbo.  In any case, even if the distribution of this term is in part a product of diffusion it is clear that reflexes of &ast;_bulaw-an_ must have been borrowed much earlier than forms of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _emas_ ‘gold’, which are transparent loans in a number of the languages of Indonesia Appendix A).  Finally, the agreement in semantic structure between Sulawesian forms such as [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _tagin bulawan_ and [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _punti bulaan_ with [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _pisaŋ emas_ (all lit. ‘golden banana’) may be a calque, but is perhaps more likely the reflex of an older term &ast;_punti bulawan_.",PAN,Canonical

This word contrasted with &ast;_buhek_ ‘head hair’ in designating all types of body hair, including facial hair (e.g. eyelashes, eyebrows, moustache), the downy feathers of birds and chickens (as opposed to e.g. the tail feathers), the fur of animals, the fine floss on fruits and the stems of plants, and the hair-like appendages on some roots. 


 In addition, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_bulu_ also functioned as the general term for ‘color; type, kind’, as evidenced by reflexes in [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404), [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) and [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390), [Nukuoro](LanguageTable#cldf:363) and [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620) (cp. the similar usage in the English expression ‘birds of a feather flock together’,). The similar use of a reflex of &ast;_bulu_ to describe a dirty-white or mousy coloration in horses both in [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) and in [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) must be a product of contact, just as [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _enáe bulu aeam_ ‘fish sp.’, [Sichule](LanguageTable#cldf:1011) _bulu ayam_ ‘fish sp.’ appear to be borrowings of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _ikan bulu ayam_, _ikan belayam_ ‘small anchovy-like fish, Makasar red fish: _Stolephorus_ sp., _Coilia_ spp., _Engraulia_ spp.’.  Finally, the nasal coda in [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414) _wulu-ŋ_ ‘body hair, fur, feathers’ probably is the general grammatical marker _-ŋ_ in [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414), rather than a reflex of &ast;_-n_.",PMP,Canonical

Although [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_bunuq_ clearly corresponded to English ‘kill’, reflexes in a number of languages in the Philippines and Sulawesi suggest that the notion encoded was more specifically that of killing by piercing, in particular by piercing with a hurled object such as a spear.

Following western contact the idea of cultivating flowers for their beauty became established, and in many of the languages of western Indonesia [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _buŋa_ was borrowed as a term for flowers artificially grown in gardens, as opposed to the natural blossoms of fruits.  In [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) terms &ast;_buaq_ ‘fruit; areca nut’ and &ast;_buŋa_ ‘flower, blossom’ underwent a co-ordinated semantic shift in which &ast;_buŋa_ surrendered its referent to an innovated term ([PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) &ast;_budak_), and took on the meaning of &ast;_buaq_, while the latter came (or continued) to apply to a wide range of roundish organic products, including grains, berries, seeds, nuts, and the endosperm of a germinating coconut, but no longer functioned as the generic term for ‘fruit’.  


It is noteworthy that after this semantic shift many of the same extended senses associated with the core meaning of &ast;_buaq_ also became associated with &ast;_buŋa_, including ‘interest on a loan’ ([Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636), the Batak languages, [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418), [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235), [Bimanese](LanguageTable#cldf:241), [Komodo](LanguageTable#cldf:708), [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678)), ‘kidney’ ([Mansaka](LanguageTable#cldf:825)), ‘mouse’ ([Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226)), and ‘words, speech’ ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427)).  The inclusion of [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _buna_ ‘sweet potato’, [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) _buŋa_ ‘sweet potato: _Ipomoea batatas L._’ could be used to justify a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) etymon but this form, referring to an introduced plant, almost certainly is a loan from one of the languages of northern Luzon (most likely [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279)).",PAN,Canonical

According to [Darlington (1957:229)](bib-Darlington) breeding populations of the saltwater crocodile populate the Pacific as far as the Southeast Solomons. However, because _Crocodilus porosus_ can cross sea intervals of up to several hundred miles individual specimens of the animal occasionally are seen much further to the east. [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) wrote &ast;_b-uh-aya_, but his arbitrary segmentation of this morpheme was based on a misunderstanding of certain aspects of the historical phonology of [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), and some other languages in western Indonesia, particularly Borneo, where prepenultimate vowels merged as schwa, and then deleted prevocalically (leaving various forms of _baya_).  


By strict application of subgrouping requirements to semantic reconstruction the meaning of &ast;_buqaya_ would remain somewhat less specific than ‘crocodile’, since the meanings in [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) and [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:MP) witnesses differ.  Despite this limitation there are at least three pieces of evidence that &ast;_buqaya_ meant ‘crocodile’ not only in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP), but also in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN): (1) a general term for ‘shark’ (&ast;_qiSu_) is already available, (2) outside Taiwan reflexes of &ast;_buqaya_ invariably carry the primary sense ‘crocodile’, (3) _C. porosus_ was earlier present on the coast of southeastern China, and hence presumably in Taiwan ([Pope 1935:65](Source#cldf:pope1935)), but disappeared before the historical period.  Under these circumstances the application of the name of a dangerous reptilian aquatic predator to its functional equivalent in the world of fishes is not surprising.  Several other inferences connected either denotatively or connotatively with &ast;_buqaya_ which do not involve an actual linguistic reconstruction nonetheless seem warranted. First, the crocodile clearly was associated with ravenous greed and rapacious behavior by at least [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) times.  Second, some type of boys’ game was played which imitated this character ([Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569), [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) and [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)).  Third, the expression ‘land crocodile’ (&ast;_buqaya ni taneq_?) referred to an unprincipled person driven by selfish greed.  Finally, a morphologically complex form of this word evidently meant ‘seahorse’ by at least [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCEMP) times ([Yamdena](LanguageTable#cldf:1130) and [Lau](LanguageTable#cldf:313)).  Reflexes in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Tontemboan](LanguageTable#cldf:19052) suggest somewhat vaguely that this usage may have a longer history, or that other types of fish may also have been designated by a reflex of &ast;_buqaya_.",PAN,Canonical

This term was the subject of a misguided discussion in the earlier literature, in which diphthongs &ast;_-ew_ and &ast;_-ey_ were proposed as addenda to those reconstructed by Dempwolff ([Dyen 1953a](Source#cldf:dyen1953), [Hendon 1964](Source#cldf:hendon1964)).  It now seems clear that &ast;_buRaw_ had two rather well-defined semantic foci: 1) it applied to the act of chasing animals from the cultivated fields, above all to frightening off birds from the rice fields by vigorous shouting (the latter element being preserved as a distinct semantic component in [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) _buro_), 2) it applied to humans, in which case the meaning was that of banishment or exile from the village (in the case of individual persons) or that of migration (in the case of the entire resident community). Since its application to animals appears to have been more frequent and fundamental, it probably is no accident that reflexes of &ast;_buRaw_ are confined largely to those societies that traditionally retained the cultivation of grain crops. 



The problems surrounding the change &ast;_-aw_ to _u_ in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and some of its closest relatives remain unsolved.  This change (and the comparable change &ast;_-ay_ to _i_) are paralleled in other forms, but are confined to [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and a few other languages of western Indonesia which are either closely related to [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), or which have numerous [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loanwords, or both.  There is thus no basis for a triangulation of the proposed &ast;_-aw_, &ast;_-ew_ and &ast;_-ay_, &ast;_-ey_ distinctions to any proto-language higher than the hypothetical immediate common ancestor of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), the Chamic languages, and perhaps [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418).  Both the irregular form and the innovative meaning show that the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) reflex of &ast;_buRaw_ was borrowed into a number of languages in the Sumatra-Java-Bali region, in a few cases resulting in etymological doublets (e.g. [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), with native _buro_ and borrowed _buru_).",PAN,Canonical

Although this term and its referent can be firmly associated with [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP), borrowing from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) has somewhat obscured its primary distribution in Indonesia.  Both Batak forms show irregular reductions of the medial consonant which point to borrowing, and for different reasons the words in [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) and Modern [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), and [Buruese](LanguageTable#cldf:251) are also suspect. Although the [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418), [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391) and [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678) forms can be treated as native, it is likely on distributional grounds that they, too, are [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loanwords.

As suggested by [Mills (1975:2:653)](Source#cldf:mills1975) there can be little doubt that this term functioned within the context of traditional shamanistic herbal medicine, referring to the action of spewing masticated medicinal herbs on the surface of the skin over a painful part of the body. The distribution of semantic reflexes suggests that premasticated betel nut was the preferred medicinal simple; the practice probably was common for stomach ailments and headache. Finally, this item illustrates the process of ‘semantic fragmentation’ ([Blust 1987](Source#cldf:blust1987)) in a striking manner, since e.g. [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _bura_ ‘remedy, medicine’ and [Molima](LanguageTable#cldf:18975) _wula_ ‘to blow out water, as a whale’ appear at first to have no common semantic ground, yet emerge as straightforward cognates once it is recognized that each has selected and developed one component of the original meaning to the exclusion of the other.",PAN,Canonical

Based on cognates only in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) posited &ast;_buni_ ‘tree sp.’.  However, he missed the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) variant _berunay_ (assumed to be a metathesis of earlier &ast;_burenay_), and did not consider the numerous Philippine forms or the rarer western Indonesian forms which attest to a medial cluster.  It is now known that [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and some other closely related languages in western Indonesia show an unexplained minor sound correspondence in the diphthong of this and a handful of other forms.  [Dyen (1949:421)](Source#cldf:dyen1949) and [Nothofer (1984)](Source#cldf:nothofer1984) have attributed this correspondence to a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) diphthong &ast;_-ey_, but their inferences cannot be justified by the normal comparative procedure of triangulation for any proto-language more remote than the immediate common ancestor of these discrepant witnesses.  


A factor which considerably complicates the problem of determining the membership of this group is the great influence that [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) has had for many centuries as a source of loanwords throughout island Southeast Asia.  To a lesser extent (both in terms of chronology, and of the geographical range of its influence) the same is true of [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), which may be the source of both [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _buni_ and [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _wuni_.",PWMP,Canonical

A number of Philippine forms that appear to reflect &ast;_buluk_ are assumed to result from a two-step borrowing process: 1. [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _buruk_ was borrowed into [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), presumably as a result of sustained Malay trading activities in the region of Manila Bay prior to the inception of the Manila Galleon in the sixteenth century ([Wolff 1976](Source#cldf:wolff1976), [Blust 1991](Source#cldf:blust1991)), 2. this form was naturalized as [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _bulók_ and then passed on to other languages, both to the north and to the south, probably within the past half millennium.  Remarkably, [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) shows a double layer of borrowing of the same semantic category from [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423): first _bugúk_, a native [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) form, then _bulúk_, a [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loan almost certainly acquired through [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423).  


It is possible, but rather uncertain on semantic grounds, that [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) _byuk_ ‘scar’ is the only directly inherited reflex of &ast;_buRuk_. Although this term meant ‘rotten’, the range of substances to which it applied remains somewhat unclear.  [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _vuk_ agrees with a few Philippine witnesses in indicating a meaning ‘rotten, of meat’.  However, in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and some other languages a reflex of &ast;_buRuk_ applies to the rotting of wood, metals and other substances in contrast to the rotting of flesh (_busok_).  Moreover, reflexes of &ast;_buRuk_ in a number of [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) and [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) languages point specifically to the addling of eggs.

In Christianized societies such as that of the Cebuano Bisayan the traditional belief has been reinterpreted in terms of a personal God exacting retribution, but the available evidence for animistic societies suggests an antecedent stage in which the punishment was impersonal and automatic.

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_busuR_ appears to have meant only ‘hunting bow’.  While the same meaning persisted in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP), many reflexes of this form both in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) and in [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) languages refer to a bow-shaped implement used to card cotton or kapok fibers.  Since _Gossypium_ species are adventitious to Southeast Asia, and presumably were introduced during the early stages of Indian contact in western Indonesia, it is unlikely that the use of &ast;_busuR_ for carding _Gossypium_ fibers has an antiquity of more than two millennia.  It is, however, possible that such an instrument was used earlier for carding the fibers of the indigenous kapok.  Phonologically irregular forms such a [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _wusu_ suggest that the practice of carding kapok fibers with a bow-like instrument may have spread from Indianized regions such as Java or the various Malay states of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula.  If so, it is surprising that the association of a reflex of &ast;_busuR_ with the carding of kapok fibers is found among the geographically more remote mountain peoples of northern Luzon, whereas reflexes in the more accessible lowland areas often refer to a hunting bow (e.g. in [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) and [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244)).  Everything considered it seems safest to conclude that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_busuR_ referred exclusively to a hunting bow, but that by [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) or at least [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) times this form had taken on the additional meaning of a bow-like instrument used to card the fiber of the silk-cotton, or kapok tree.",PAN,Canonical

This exceptionally complicated comparison requires extensive comment.  The following numbered points concerning first the shape, then the morphology and finally the meaning of &ast;_Cakaw_ and its derivatives should cover the major issues:  



(1) All [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) reflexes of &ast;_Cakaw_ which distinguish &ast;_C_ from &ast;_t_ point unambiguously to &ast;_C_ in this form.  Outside Taiwan, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_t-_ (the outcome of the merger of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_C_ and &ast;_t_) is widely reflected as the stem-initial consonant, but there are a number of irregularities, including the unexplained loss of &ast;_t-_ in some of the languages of northern Luzon and the widespread nasal replacement of &ast;_t_ in other languages.  The latter irregularities will be treated below under morphology.  Although both [Samal](LanguageTable#cldf:981) (southern Philippines) on the one hand, and the Batak languages and [Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361) (northern Sumatra) on the other hand, reflect a form with medial prenasalization, I take the prenasalization of &ast;_k_ in this word to be a product of two independent changes.  



(2) [Milke (1968:149)](Source#cldf:milke1968) proposed a doublet &ast;_nakaw_ next to Dempwolff's &ast;_ta(ŋ)kaw_ ‘steal’.  Although forms compatible with &ast;_nakaw_ occur in forms such as [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294) _nakau_ ‘steal’, [Singhi Land Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:412) _noku_ ‘steal’, and [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _naŋko_ ‘steal’, these items are synchronically derived form stems with initial _t_.  The same cannot, however, be said of [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) _náko_, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _nákaw_ ‘steal’ and of widespread reflexes of &ast;_nakaw_ in the Lesser Sundas and central Moluccas.  A doublet &ast;_nakaw_ thus seems unavoidable, despite the fact that in some languages forms of the same shape are regual morphological derivatives of a reflex of &ast;_takaw_.  



(3) Although [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226) _panákaw_ ‘theft’, [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _panakau_ ‘thievish, stealing inveterately’ and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _panaŋko_ ‘thief’ are derived synchronically from underlying disyllables with initial _t_, [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _panakaw_, [Manobo (Kalamansig Cotabato)](LanguageTable#cldf:820) _penakaw_, [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _fenakwa_, [Kadazan Dusun](LanguageTable#cldf:287) _panakau_ and reflexes of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_panako_ ‘steal’ are independent lexical entries.  We might, therefore, posit a third [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) doublet &ast;_panakaw_ next to &ast;_takaw_ and &ast;_nakaw_, an interpretation which appears to be supported by the reconstructions &ast;_panakaw-an_ and &ast;_panakaw-en_.  However, the evidence for a doublet &ast;_panakaw_ differs from the evidence for a doublet &ast;_nakaw_ in one crucial respect: [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) clearly had a prefix &ast;_paŋ-_ which, among other things, derived agentive nouns, whereas there is little reason to believe that active verbs were derived by simple homorganic nasal substitution (as opposed to prefixation with &ast;_maŋ-_).  The patterning of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) morphology thus suggests that &ast;_panakaw_ is a morphological derivative of &ast;_takaw_. Despite this conclusion two serious problems remain: 1. &ast;_panakaw_ presumably meant ‘thief’, yet of the available reflexes only [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _panaŋko_ supports this interpretation, most languages reflecting &ast;_panakaw_ as a verb or as a non-agentive noun which itself can be affixed to form a verb, 2. reflexes of &ast;_panakaw_ have become independent lexical items in a number of widely distributed languages, yet this has not happened to other morphological derivatives of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_takaw_.  



(4) The morphology of some reflexes of &ast;_Cakaw_ appears superficially to be cognate, but does not stand up to closer inspection.  Thus, [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) _hanaʔo_ ‘rob, steal’ appears at first to reflect &ast;_panakaw_, but on closer examination appears instead to contain the Tetun causative prefex _ha-_ plus a reflex of &ast;_nakaw_.  Similarly, [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _ma-tsakaw_ ‘be, become stolen’ and [Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) _ma-sakaw_ ‘steal, rob’ appear at first to be cognate with [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) _ma-tako_ ‘thievish’, [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _mo-takow_ ‘thievish in nature’, but the Sulawesian forms clearly contain a reflex of &ast;_ma-_ ‘stative’, whereas the [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) forms do not.  Likewise, the similarity of [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) _manako_ (_ma-nako_) and of [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _menako_ ‘steal’ to the [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) and [Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) forms, or to [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _mag-tákaw_ ‘steal’, appears to be a product of convergent innovations in languages that in any case share a common ancestral morphology.  



(5) Most challenging of all is the task of interrelating the affixed forms of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_Cakaw_ and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_takaw_.  [Wolff (1973)](Source#cldf:wolff1973) has proposed a convincing system of verbal affixation in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) which distinguishes independent from future-general action dependent subjunctive modes.  The independent mode of verbs includes active, direct passive (DP), local passive (LP) and instrumental passive (IP) voices in both nonpast (_-um-_, _-en_, _-an_, _i-_ respectively), and past tense forms (_-inum-_, _-in-_, _-in-_..._-an_, _i-_..._-an_).  At the [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) level the direct available evidence permits us to reconstruct &ast;_Cakaw_ and &ast;_C-in-akaw_.  The former was the stem for verb forms meaning ‘steal’, but when unaffixed probably meant ‘theft’.  The latter clearly meant ‘what is stolen, stolen goods’.  However, more generally [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_-in-_ had two functions: (1) it was a common nominalizer (as in &ast;_C-in-akaw_); (2) it marked the past tense of all four verbal voices, for the active, LP, and IP in combination with other affixes, but for the DP it occurred with a zero allomorph of the DP suffix &ast;_-en_, thus acquiring a ‘portmanteau’ function. The forms which have been reconstructed above are only a fragment of what must have been a fuller paradigm, pieces of which are preserved either in the available [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) evidence or the available [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:MP) evidence, but not in both.  Taking into account the morphological evidence form other cognate sets we can tentatively posit the following [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) paradigm for &ast;_Cakaw_: 


<table align=""center"" border=""1"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""0""><tr><th colspan=""5""> &ast;<span class=""pwd"">Cakaw</span> ‘theft’</th></tr>
<tr><th width=""50""> </th><th width=""50"">active</th><th width=""50"">DP</th><th width=""50"">LP</th><th width=""50"">IP</th></tr>
<tr><td>NonPast</td><th> <span class=""wd"">C-um-akaw</span> </th><th> <span class=""wd"">Cakaw-en</span></th><th> <span class=""wd"">Cakaw-an</span></th><th>?</th></tr>
<tr><td>Past</td><th>?</th><th> <span class=""wd"">C-in-akaw</span> </th><th>?</th><th>?</th></tr>
</table>


The active nonpast form &ast;_C-um-akaw_ is reflected in [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _ts-m-akaw_ ‘steal; do secretly’ and the irregular [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) _um-áko-áko_ ‘steal frequently, be a thief’.  No reflexes of &ast;_C-inum-akaw_ (Wolff's past active) are known.  The nonpast direct passive &ast;_Cakaw-en_ is recorded only from Philippine languages, but must have been present in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) if &ast;_C-in-akaw_ functioned both as a noun and as the past tense form of the direct passive.  Reflexes of &ast;_Cakaw-an_ are known only in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages, where they do not clearly reflect a local passive meaning.  This meaning is, however, clearly reflected in [Kadazan Dusun](LanguageTable#cldf:287) _panaka-an_ ‘the place where one steals’ and [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _ponakaw-an_ ‘place where something was stolen or will be stolen’.  No past tense form of the local passive, nor any form of the instrumental voice or the future-general action dependent subjunctive mode is known for this form.  



(6) The principal changes which the foregoing paradigm underwent in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) were the innovation of &ast;_manakaw_ and &ast;_panakaw_.  Both &ast;_t-um-akaw_ and &ast;_manakaw_ must have coexisted for some time as markers of the nonpast active voice in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP), but the latter appears to have dominated the former.  It is unclear whether [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) &ast;_mananakaw_ derives from a form prefixed with &ast;_manaŋ-_, or from a form prefixed with &ast;_maŋ-_ followed by reduplication of the first stem syllable.  



(7) The focal meaning of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_Cakaw_, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_takaw_ was ‘steal’.  In addition to this gloss, however, &ast;_Cakaw_, &ast;_takaw_ evidently included the meaning ‘do secretly’, as such a sense is reflected in [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370), [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394), and perhaps [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) and [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) (in both of which the notion of clandestine or illicit sexual relations is also expressed).",PAN,Canonical

This item clearly is identical with [Dempwolff's (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) &ast;_taliŋa_ ‘ear’, but various compounds probably existed in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) which indicated the widespread association of at least some types of mushrooms with ghosts on the one hand, and with thunder or lightning on the other (see, for example, [Lévi-Strauss 1976](Source#cldf:levistrauss1976) or [Blust 2000](Source#cldf:blust2000)).

It seems clear that the fundamental sense of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_CaliS_ and its reflexes was ‘rope, twine, string’ --- that is, manufactured cordage as opposed to natural tying materials.  Nonetheless, this word often is replaced by a reflex of &ast;_waRej_ ‘vine’ in [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages, presumably because in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) society vines had become a major material for ropes (cp. [Nauna](LanguageTable#cldf:355) of the eastern Admiralties, where _way_ < &ast;_waRoj_ can mean either ‘vine’ or ‘rope’, but _tIl_ < [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_tali_ can mean only ‘rope’, never ‘vine’).  The reference to pig nets or a rope to hold up a pig net in [Tontemboan](LanguageTable#cldf:19052) of northern Sulawesi and [Tawala](LanguageTable#cldf:1056) of southeastern Papua may be a result of convergence, but it seems at least as likely that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_talih_ was part of the name for some type of trap for ensnaring wild pigs.  Similarly, the reference to entangling snakes in [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) and [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) may reflect a metaphorical or high frequency phrasal usage of [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) &ast;_talih_.",PAN,Canonical

As a concrete noun &ast;_CaNem_ seems to have meant ‘grave’, as shown by reflexes in [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293), [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), [Itawis](LanguageTable#cldf:648), [Lun Dayeh](LanguageTable#cldf:19418), [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299), [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294), [Murik](LanguageTable#cldf:869), and [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235) (morphological derivatives in [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) and [Tuvaluan](LanguageTable#cldf:19417) suggest that the base alone is now primarily a verb or abstract noun in these languages). As a verb both ‘to plant’ and ‘to bury’ are widespread in Malayo-Polynesian languages, and evidently co-occurred in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP). However, it should be noted that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_mula_ also meant ‘to plant’. Although this observation might be taken as evidence to favor the gloss ‘to bury’ for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_tanem_, the glosses of reflexes suggest that this form referred especially to the planting (and transplanting) of rice, while [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_mula_ referred to the planting of other cultigens.



All Cristobal-Malaitan forms cited here are listed under _ano_ ‘earth’ (< [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_taneq_) in the individual dictionaries, but the thematic consonant _–m_ strongly suggests that they derive from &ast;_tanem_; in a number of other Oceanic languages it is unclear whether bases of the shape _tano_ reflect &ast;_taneq_ ‘earth, soil’, or &ast;_tanem_ ‘to bury, plant’, and it is likely that the two forms became derivationally related in the thinking of many speakers.  [Proto-Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_tanom_ underwent an irregular change to [Proto-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19084) &ast;_tanu_, with the innovative vowel then passed on to its descendants.

This important term provides one of the key pieces of evidence that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_-aS_ and  &ast;_-eS_ merged as [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_-ah_. Although reflexes of &ast;_CumeS_ are widespread they are not nearly as common as those of &ast;_kuCu_ ‘head louse’, thus suggesting that the latter term had greater psychological salience than the former.  This observation is perhaps related to the fact that delousing as a socially significant grooming activity almost invariably involves the removal of head lice rather than body lice --- a behavioral trait which appears to be shared with other primates (as chimpanzees), and which therefore probably has pre-human origins.  In the absence of other evidence for a prefix &ast;_ka-_ which could be added to animal names I tentatively assume that the initial elements in [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) _ke-tuma_ and [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) _ka-tuma_ are products of historically unrelated morphological processes.",PAN,Canonical
25936,roast food over a fire,tsuchida1976[133],*CuNuh,"Also [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _tino_ ‘what is singed, singed off (hair, feathers); what is roasted on hot coals’; _ma-nino_ ‘to singe off hair or feathers, roast on hot coals’, [Laha](LanguageTable#cldf:19289) _kunu-r_ ‘to bake’, [Lou](LanguageTable#cldf:322) _nunun_ ‘roast over hot coals’.  The basic sense of this term seems to have been ‘to roast (tubers, meat, fish, etc.)’, with reference either to an open fire or to a bed of embers --- in other words, to cook without water or fat by direct exposure to heat.  Reflexes in [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124) and [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) suggest that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_tunu_ also applied to the firing of clay pots, a concept which is in every sense similar to that of roasting except that the object is inorganic.  In many of the available sources a reflex of &ast;_CuNuh_ is additionally given as the translation equivalent of ‘to set on fire, to kindle, to ignite (as a lamp)’ and ‘to burn (something)’.  


Reflexes in [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) and [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) suggest that this verb was applied to the burning of calcium carbonate to make quicklime, but it is not entirely clear whether it could be applied to any type of object.  In addition the agreement of [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) and several languages of central and southern Sulawesi in supporting the meaning ‘to sacrifice animals’ suggests that &ast;_CuNuh_ referred to burnt offerings, presumably as a part of funeral ceremonies.  One other recurrent semantic reflex --- that of the firing of a weapon ([Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361), many [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) languages) is assumed to be a convergent innovation following the introduction of firearms.  Finally, in parts of the central Solomons the ritualistic practice among young males of raising cicatrices on the skin through burning evidently led to a semantic shift to ‘mark left by burning’, and then just ‘dot, spot, blot’ ([Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359)).

The prototypical object for stringing was beads, which were strung into necklaces, while that for skewering probably was fish, which were skewered for roasting. The loss of the medial consonant of this form through regular sound change produced a canonically anomalous monosyllabic content word in some languages, and it was perhaps in response to this situation that the [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) transitive suffix &ast;_-i_ was reanalyzed as part of the stem.",PAN,Canonical

This is one of the most distinctive innovations defining the Philippine subgroup, as it is an item of basic vocabulary that appears to have replaced &ast;_Raya_ ‘big, large, great’.  Despite its general regularity there are a surprising number of irregular reflexes of this form, including unexplained gemination of &ast;_k_ in several northern Philippine languages, loss of &ast;_-l_ in [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289) and replacement of &ast;_l_ by glottal stop in [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) Reflexes of &ast;_dakelaq_ are confined to members of the Greater Central Philippine group and appear to be derivatives of &ast;_dakel_, although the actual morphological relationship is obscure in most languages.

This verb is well-supported by reflexes in the Philippines and western Indonesia which are clearly cognate with [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _sakup_, but reflexes in CEMP languages are virtually unknown ([Capell 1968](Source#cldf:capell1968) lists [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _rako-va_ ‘embrace’ only in the English index, and pace <span class=""bib""><a class=""bib"" href=""acd-bib.htm#Dempwolff"">Dempwolff 1938</a></span> this may be a chance resemblance).  


The fundamental meaning of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_dakep_ appears to have been ‘to seize, catch something that is trying to escape’.  With smaller animals this would involve use of the hands, but with larger animals (as pigs) or people it would involve both arms, thus leading to the extended meaning ‘to embrace’ in several languages (where the object is not trying to escape).  However, semantic agreements between [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) and [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) forms of this base suggest that an affixed (perhaps reduplicated) may also have referred to the childrens’ game of ‘tag’, and agreements between the Batak languages of northern Sumatra and [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) of southern Sulawesi indicate that at a later period it may have functioned further as a term of measurement for the girth of trees or other objects that are measured by an ‘embrace’.",PAN,Canonical

This is an extremely rich comparison in terms of the many directions that the primary sense has taken in various daughter languages.  The basic meaning of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_dalem_ appears to have been ‘insides, area within, inner part of something’.  From this sense it originally had or developed a secondary sense of ‘inner self, feelings, disposition’, an association that is strikingly exhibited by [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _dálem_ or [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _si-daḷom_ ‘liver’ (the seat of the emotions in traditional Austronesian-speaking societies), and that becomes increasingly more prominent in the glosses of compounds in southern Sulawesi, eastern Indonesia, Melanesia and Micronesia (but not in Polynesia).  


A second meaning of this term that is found throughout the language family is ‘deep’, both in a physical sense (deep water, deep pit), and in the abstract sense of ‘profound, as an idea’.  Through the latter nuance it has developed into the verb ‘to think, to remember’ in languages such as [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345). Finally, preceded by the generic locative marker &ast;_i_ the expression _&ast;i dalem_ meant ‘in, inside, within’.

Although [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_danaw_ apparently meant ‘lake’, the exact meaning of this term would have depended upon the region of Taiwan that was occupied while [Proto-Austronesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) remained a single language, since lakes are found in some parts of the island but not in others.  The wide but rather scattered distribution of reflexes elsewhere can probably be attributed to the absence of lakes or significant large bodies of fresh water in many of the environments in which Austronesian speakers settled after leaving Taiwan.  In some areas a reflex of &ast;_danaw_ came to apply to lagoons (salt water), ponds (permanent but small collections of fresh water), or just puddles (temporary collections of fresh water after rain).  


In parts of interior Borneo, where rivers are of major importance but lakes are virtually nonexistent, reflexes of this term were retained but shifted in meaning to refer to muddy areas where rainwater tended to collect but not cover the ground for long; this tendency was carried furthest in [Murik](LanguageTable#cldf:869) where from ‘muddy area, mudpatch’ the meaning developed to ‘muddy’ (still attested in the closely-related [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294)), and then to ‘dirty’.  In other areas where lakes occur, but are rare a reflex of &ast;_danaw_ came to refer to a particular lake, and so was preserved only in proper names, as in [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) and [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816).  


The most puzzling distribution is seen in the Oceanic group, where no reflex has been identified so far except in the Central Pacific languages ([Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394), [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266), Polynesian), which implies that prior to reaching western  Polynesia Austronesian speakers were either in continuous contact with bodies of fresh water that were designated by a reflex of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_rano_, or that they moved through areas that lacked lakes so rapidly that the term was retained in the absence of a referent until arriving in a new environment in which lakes were again encountered.

Reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_danum_ have a peculiar distribution: they are common in Taiwan and the northern Philippines, but were replaced by other terms throughout the central and southern Philippines, and throughout all of Indonesia apart from the Barito Basin in southeast Borneo.  In the Pacific they have a rather scattered distribution, being absent from Vanuatu except for two very small areas in west Santo and the Shepherd Islands.  Finally, although most languages reflect only one or the other of these two terms both are found in the Admiralty Islands, where one is the common word for ‘fresh water’ in one language, and the other the semantic equivalent in a closely related language.  In Fiji and Polynesia both occur in the same languages, but with different meanings (PPn &ast;_wai_ ‘fresh water’ : _(&ast;faka-)ranu_ ‘rinse with fresh water after bathing in the sea’), and in [Wayan](LanguageTable#cldf:19060) of western Fiji they co-occur in a single expression (_wai dranu_ ‘fresh water’, as opp. _wai tasi_ ‘salt water’).",PAN,Canonical

The basic sense of this word in both [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) was clearly ‘to hear’ both in the sense of receiving an auditory impression and in the sense of receiving information, or news (hence: ‘to hear about’).  As in many traditional cultures where knowledge was transmitted orally, the sense of ‘to hear’ or ‘to listen’ also incorporates connotations of ‘to understand’.  Other meanings that derive from the primary notion of hearing are ‘to obey, heed’, and ‘fame, reputation; famous’ (= ‘heard about, bruited about’).  The most puzzling semantic feature of this base is its extension in a number of Oceanic languages to any sense other than that of sight.  Although this is rarely mentioned in glosses of reflexes outside the Oceanic subgroup, there are indications of a similar notion in [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _reni_ ‘heard; perceived, as a scent’, and [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414) _rena_ ‘to feel, have a feeling, as in feeling feverish; feeling, sentiment’.

This cognate set shows a rather clear semantic innovation in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP), since only the verb ‘to lick’ can be posited for [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN); note that [Favorlang/Babuza](LanguageTable#cldf:19018) and [Siraya](LanguageTable#cldf:416) reflexes of this base meaning ‘tongue’ are formed by _Ca-_ reduplication, a process that is known to occur with some other body-parts ([Blust 1998:38](Source#cldf:blust1998)).  Just as _Ca-_reduplications of &ast;_dilaq_ can mean ‘tongue’ in Formosan languages, affixed forms of &ast;_dilaq_ can mean ‘to lick’ in Malayo-Polynesian languages, but this appears never to be the case for the bare stem.  


Two other semantic developments are noteworthy.  First, once this base had come to mean ‘tongue’ it was then incorporated into expressions meaning ‘to gossip’, ‘to be talkative’, and the like.  Second, in several of the languages of western Indonesia reflexes of &ast;_dilaq_ came to refer to tongues of flame, perhaps beginning in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and then spreading through literary use.  This notion then evolved further into much more opaque semantic relationships, as with [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) _dilaʔ_ ‘to light up, illuminate’.  Finally, reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_dilaq_ evidently also figured in the names of certain plants, although the details of these collocations are not recoverable from currently available data.  Part of the Formosan evidence for this cognate set was first proposed by [Tsuchida (1976:154)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976).",PAN,Canonical

[Yakan](LanguageTable#cldf:1129) _duyan_ a (wide) swing, hammock made of rattan is assumed to be a Greater Central Philippines loan.  Hammocks were invented in the tropical rainforests of South America, and so far as is known, nowhere else.  [Bennett (1963:24)](Source#cldf:bennett1963) notes that they “have a wide distribution in Amazonia, the Guianas, Venezuela, and the West Indies, and are also found among the Goajiro of Venezuela, the Cuna and Chocó of tropical Colombia, and the Cueva of Colombia.... Hammocks ae not found in east Brazil, with the exception of the Cre’pumkateye, who are known to have borrowed them.  They are likewise rare in the Chaco, although used as baby cradles by some groups.”  Since hammocks are absent elsewhere in the Austronesian world it seems most reasonable to infer that this word originally referred to a swinging cradle for an infant, and was then extended to include the hammock, which presumably was introduced during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines.

Although European folk traditions tend to see the dugong as a type of aquatic cow (probably because it grazes the sea grass on the ocean floor), Austronesian speakers tend to see it instead as a type of marine pig, probably based on its facial features.  In addition to the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) variant _babi duyoŋ_ (‘pig dugong’) a comparison of dugongs and pigs is seen in [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _babuy na raziŋ_ (‘pig of the sea’) ‘dugong’ (glossed erroneously as ‘dolphin’ in [Li and Tsuchida 2006)](Source#cldf:liandtsuchida2006), and in [Wogeo](LanguageTable#cldf:19063) _ika boro_ (‘pig fish’) ‘dugong’.

In addition to the indisputably cognate forms cited above it is tempting to compare [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _e_ ‘prefix used to form number words that refer to units of time’.  However, cognates are unknown in any other non-[OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) language, and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) mid vowels &ast;_e_ and &ast;_o_ are rare and problematic.  For these reasons I treat [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _e_ as a chance resemblance.  



In the standard grammars of [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) and several of the Polynesian languages the numeral marker _e_ is equated with the predicative or existential marker of similar shape which is widespread in [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages.  However, it is noteworthy that reflexes of &ast;_e_ ‘numeral marker’ are known to be distributed only from the western Solomons to Polynesia, whereas reflexes of the variant &ast;_i_ ‘numeral marker’ are found both in [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) and in [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages.  



One hypothesis worthy of further investigation is that a numeral marker &ast;_i_ was innovated in [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCEMP) and a predicative or existential marker &ast;_e_ was innovated in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC), with a subsequent tendency for the former (which was syntactically more restricted) to be equated with the latter (which was syntactically freer).  Just how restricted the distribution of the numeral marker &ast;_i_, &ast;_e_ was remains unclear, but in most languages it does not occur with ‘one’, and in many others it does not occur with numerals above ‘five’.",POC,Canonical

The meaning of this form is problematic.  If we simply conjoin the attested glosses it would seem to follow that &ast;_ema_ meant both ‘mother’ and ‘father’.  Such a result, however, would be anomalous, since (1) the meanings ‘mother’ and ‘father’ are represented by [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_ina_ and &ast;_ama_ respectively, and (2) reflexes of &ast;_ina_ apparently never mean ‘father’ and reflexes of &ast;_ama_ apparently never mean ‘mother’.  If we posit &ast;_ina_ and &ast;_ama_ as referential terms, and &ast;_ema_ as vocative, we can eliminate the problem of synonymy raised in (1), since then &ast;_ina_ = ‘mother (ref.)’, &ast;_ema_ = ‘mother (voc.)’, &ast;_ama_ = ‘father (ref.)’, and &ast;_ema_ = ‘father (voc.)’. Nonetheless, we would still have no explanation for the unique occurrence of a single vocative form representing two address forms.  Similarly, we cannot support an inference that the material cited here reflects &ast;_ama_ with oxytone stress, since the divergent semantic evolution of cognates assigned to &ast;_amá_ would remain problematic in any case.  



Alternatively, we might assume that &ast;_ema_ was used in teknonyms, as reported for [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) and [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816).  Even so, the problem of a single teknonym meaning both ‘mother’ and ‘father’ would remain unsolved. The only parallel to the semantic range of &ast;_ema_ known to me is that of &ast;_aya_ ‘FZ’, which is reflected in some languages with the meaning ‘mother’ and in others with the meaning ‘father’, but which also appears in a few languages with the meaning ‘aunt’, or specifically, ‘FZ’.  Perhaps &ast;_ema_ was a vocative/address form of &ast;_aya_, just as &ast;_mama_ was a vocative/address form of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_(ma)tuqah_ ‘MB’.  If so, however, the absence of any reflex which refers exclusively to female collaterals of the parental generation is puzzling, as is the use of the apparently redundant vocative marker _-ʔ_ (for further discussion of vocative marking in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) cf.

This comparison is complex in a number of respects.  First, although it is the most common, it is only one of four stem variants: &ast;_ampu_, &ast;_empu_, &ast;_impu_, and &ast;_umpu_.  Second, an unusual number of affixed forms can be reconstructed next to the simple base. Some of these, as &ast;_empu-ŋ_, &ast;_empu-q_, and &ast;_t-empu_ evidently involved distinctions of vocative/address and referential forms ([Blust 1979](Source#cldf:blust1979)).  Another, &ast;_empu-ni-a_, involves what appears initially to be a possessed kinship term (cp. &ast;_ama-ni-a_ ‘his/her father’) which on closer inspection turns out to function very differently from other kinship terms followed by the genitive marker &ast;_ni_ and the 3sg. object pronoun &ast;_-a_.  The common reflex of &ast;_-i_ ‘local transitive’ in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _mem-pu-ña-i_ and [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) _punnà-i_ ‘have, possess’, suggests an etymon &ast;_empu-ni-a-i_.  However, since &ast;_empu-ni-a_ evidently meant ‘its owner’ (lit. ""owner-of-it""), the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) constructions in -/_i_/ must have arisen after the reanalysis of &ast;_empu-ni-a_ as a verb &ast;_empuña_, and hence is a product of independent parallel changes. Likewise, the morphological similarity of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _per-empu-an_ ‘woman; feminine; womanly (courtly, and in titles)’ and [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _pog-ompu-on_ ‘children and grandchildren’ appears to have ho historical basis (cp. [Malay (Jakarta)](LanguageTable#cldf:18430) _perempuan_ ‘woman’, with last-syllable vowel indicating &ast;_-an_, not &ast;_-en_).  



Perhaps most problematic are the forms assigned to &ast;_maki-empu_ and &ast;_paki-empu_.  With regard to the first of these [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) clearly reflects a prefix &ast;_maki-_ which remains a functional (non-fossilized) affix in such languages as [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) (/_maki_/- ‘prefix used to indicate that something is done with others, etc.’), [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) (/maki/- ask for or make a request for; join in company; imitate’) and [Murut (Timugon)](LanguageTable#cldf:1067) (/_maki_/- ‘petitive’; also /_amaʔ_/ ‘father’:/_maki-amaʔ_/ ‘subject calls object ""father"" ‘, cited in [Prentice 1971:135](Source#cldf:prentice1971)).  Since the [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) form is supported by the parallel but unglossed [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) form _machi-apo_, cited under _apo_ ‘GP/GC’ (reflecting the variant &ast;_ampu_), the total comparison appears to be explained most simply by assuming loss of the last prefixal vowel independently in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_mokompu_ ‘grandchild’ (with regressive assimilation of the remaining first syllable vowel), and in such [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) forms as [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _makumpu opu_ ‘GGC’ and [Dampelas](LanguageTable#cldf:18954) _maʔupu_ ‘GC’.  Foreshortened forms such as [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _k-empu_ ‘GC’, [Rejang](LanguageTable#cldf:389) _k-epew_ ‘GC’ and [Uma](LanguageTable#cldf:19170) _k-umpu_ ‘GC’ can be assigned arbitrarily to forms that begin either with &ast;_maki-_ or with &ast;_paki-_. Semantically, &ast;_empu_ and its variants also present a complex picture.  



Among relatively uncontroversial [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) meanings for all four variants are: (1) GP/GC (recipr.), (2) ancestor, and (3) lord, master, owner.  Meaning (1) places &ast;_empu_ among the set of kinship terms, but it is the only reciprocal term that can be reconstructed for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP).  Meaning (2) appears to underlie references to totemism in [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _empo_, [Numfor](LanguageTable#cldf:364) _k-epu_, and perhaps in some other languages (see below), while meaning (3) probably underlies at least two seemingly unrelated semantic developments: the meaning ‘parent-in-law’ and the meaning ‘crocodile’.  Reflexes of &ast;_empu_ or one of its variants mean ‘parent-in-law’ in such widely separated languages as [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) (_(h)empo_), [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) (_empo_), [Kédang](LanguageTable#cldf:695) (_epu_), [Tolai](LanguageTable#cldf:19416) (_tabu-na_), and [Kilivila](LanguageTable#cldf:19026) (_tabu_).  Among the [Kédang](LanguageTable#cldf:695), who practice matrilateral cross-cousin marriage, the term also refers to the mother's brother, and among the [Kilivila](LanguageTable#cldf:19026), who practice patrilateral cross-cousin marriage, it refers to the father's sister.  



I have found no generally accepted explanation for the grouping of terms for grandparents and parents-in-law under reflexes of the same etymon in Austronesian languages, but the alignment follows naturally from a hypothesis that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) speakers practiced matrilateral cross-cousin marriage, since under such an arrangement the wife-giving group is universally regarded as ‘lord, master, owner’ of the wife-taking group ([Blust 1993](Source#cldf:blust1993), and references therein). The term &ast;_empu_ (and its variants) in meaning (3), then, could have acquired its affinal sense through its use as a title reflecting the higher status of the descent group represented by the MB/WF as against that of the ZS/DH.  The recurrent association of grandparents or ancestors with crocodiles and/or other large, dangerous animals is seen in e.g. [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _bébéʔ_ ‘GP/GC; kind of large, black, extremely poisonous snake, considered by the Tiruray to be the original kind of snake, and to have been born of human parents as a twin to a Tiruray child’, [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _empo_ ‘nickname for the crocodile’ (in West Manggarai = ‘crocodile’), [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391) _empoʔ_ ‘GP/GC; crocodile’, Kedayan _bapa_ ‘term of address for the category _epu_; crocodile’ ([Barnes 1974:246-47](Source#cldf:barnes1974)), and in general anthropological references to the Berawan ([Metcalf 1982:254, 257](Source#cldf:metcalf1982)), Malagasy ([Frazer 1960:601ff](Source#cldf:frazer1960)), Mentawai  ([Loeb 1972 [1935]:166](bib-Loeb)), Atoni ([Schulte Nordholt 1971:323](Source#cldf:schultenordholt1971)), where the crocodile is regarded as the ancestor of the ruler of Kupang), and various societies of the southeastern Solomons ([Codrington 1891:178ff](bib-Codrington)).  Such widespread associations may be products of convergent development, but are more likely to reflect totemic ideas that were present in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP)  social organization, together with a mixture of fear and respect for the crocodile as the ‘lord, master, owner’ of the all-important rivers around which Austronesian speakers so often settled. Finally, the semantic connection of [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) _peŋ-empo-n_ with [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _paŋ-empw-an_ is clarified by the discussion of the ‘rice mother’ in [Frazer (1960:479-87)](Source#cldf:frazer1960).",PMP,Canonical

26111,verbal suffix marking patient or undergoer voice; nominal suffix marking product of an action or thing affected by an action,,*-en,"&ast;_-en_ is one of the most important affixes that can be reconstructed for [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN), [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) and [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP).  Like other affixes in the ‘focus system’ it evidently marked voice in verbal constructions, and at the same time served to create deverbal nominals.  Both functions are widely attested, the latter often fossilized in reflexes of &ast;_kaen-en_ ‘be eaten/what is eaten = cooked rice’. The use of &ast;_-en_ to mark passive imperatives has not been noted in [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) languages to date, but is widespread in the Philippines and western Indonesia. In some languages, as [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244), there is a synchronic contrast between imperative marking with a reflex of &ast;_-en_, and an alternative marking with a reflex of &ast;_-a_.  The former alternative occurs when a short (agent/possessor) pronoun immediately follows the suffixed verb, while the latter occurs without the pronoun.  In other languages (as [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299)) imperatives which use a reflex of &ast;_-en_ are felt to be ‘softer’ or more polite than imperatives which do not make use of passive verb  morphology (in this connection cp. also [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) passive imperatives/dehortatives in _di-_, as with _Jaŋan di-gaŋgu guru-mu!_ ‘Don't disturb your teacher!’).  



Since at least two forms of imperative marking can be reconstructed for [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP), it would be worth trying to determine whether a similar contrast existed in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN).  Possibly related (because it is irrealis) is the use of a reflex of &ast;_-en_ to mark future or intended action in [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) and several Philippine languages, including Hiligaynon Bisayan and [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226). 



In addition to the above uses, several languages in the Philippines and western Indonesia use a reflex of &ast;_-en_ to mark various types of usually visible bodily afflictions (skin diseases and the like), as well as comparable conditions of decay or deterioration in non-human subjects (e.g. &ast;_bubuk-en_ ‘crumbling, of something infested with weevils’).  Finally, reflexes of &ast;_-en_ are used in some kin terms to mark collaterality, as with &ast;_anak_ ‘child, offspring’, but &ast;_anak-en_ ‘niece, nephew’, &ast;_ama_ ‘father’ but &ast;_ama-en_ ‘uncle’, &ast;_ina_ ‘mother’, but &ast;_ina-en_ ‘aunt’, etc.",PAN,Canonical

This comparison illustrates the inherent voicing instability in velar stops, especially the voiced velar stop ([Blust 1996a](Source#cldf:blust1996)).  The weight of the evidence favors &ast;_g-_ in both [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP), but — as noted by [Mills (1975:728)](Source#cldf:mills1975) — this was replaced by _k-_ in a number of daughter languages.  Although the primary sense of this term, and the only sense that can be attributed to [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) on present evidence, is ‘itch, feel itchy’, it is clear from a number of reflexes in the Philippines and Indonesia that the word also functioned as a double-entendre for sexual lust.  Moreover, the reflexes in [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226), [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), [Gayō](LanguageTable#cldf:610), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) and perhaps [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) suggest that &ast;_gatel_ in the sense of ‘sexually itchy, oversexed’ applied particularly to women, and hence referred to nymphomania in addition to itchiness of the skin.",PAN,Canonical

It is unclear whether the meaning ‘comb’ in Formosan reflexes of &ast;_garuC_ is original or secondary.

[POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_pasok_ ‘to plant (in general)’ does not appear to be an affixed form of &ast;_hasek_, but probably contains the same root &ast;[-sek₂](root-acd-r_s1.htm#-sek₂) ‘insert, stick into a soft surface’.",PMP,Canonical

Two semantic features of this kinship term appear to be beyond dispute: 1. it referred to affines, 2. these affines were of Ego's generation.  However, the glosses in the more detailed dictionaries and in studies devoted specifically to kinship (as [Elkins and Hendrickson 1984](bib-Elkins)) show clearly that in most attested languages reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_hipaR_ are restricted to a specific subset of same generation affines.  The challenge to semantic reconstruction with &ast;_hipaR_, then, is to define this subset of kin on the basis of well-supported arguments.  


Where the reflex of &ast;_hipaR_ is not simply glossed ‘BIL, ZIL’, it typically refers to a subset of same generation affines defined by relative sex.  There are three fairly well-attested patterns: (1) in a number of the languages of Mindanao in the southern Philippines, and in [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) of northern Luzon, reflexes of &ast;_hipaR_ mean ‘sibling-in-law of the opposite sex’, that is: BW > (m.s.), ZH (w.s.), WZ and HB; (2) in a number of the languages of Mindanao and in [Gaddang](LanguageTable#cldf:268) of the northern Philippines reflexes of &ast;_hipaR_ mean ‘sibling-in-law’ of the opposite sex (any speaker) and sibling-in-law of the same sex (w.s.)’, that is: BW (m.s.), BW (w.s.), ZH (w.s.), WZ, HB, and HZ; (3) in western [Subanen/Subanun](LanguageTable#cldf:421) of the southern Philippines and in a number of [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages including [Lakalai](LanguageTable#cldf:877), [Eddystone/Mandegusu](LanguageTable#cldf:261), [Varisi](LanguageTable#cldf:1101), and [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485), simple reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP)  &ast;_hipaR_ mean ‘sibling-in-law of the same sex’, that is: BW (w.s.), ZH (w.s.), WB, and HZ; in [Gedaged](LanguageTable#cldf:269) and [Tanga](LanguageTable#cldf:425) a reflex of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_hipaR_ also means ‘sibling-in-law of the same sex’, except that further distinctions are made with other qualifying words. 


The latter pattern is so predominant in the available data for [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) systems that it seems fairly safe to infer that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_ipaR_ meant ‘sibling-in-law of the same sex’, as was done by [Milke (1958)](Source#cldf:milke1958).  Milke's [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) reconstruction raises two questions: 1. What was the [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) term for ‘sibling-in-law of the opposite sex’?, 2. can the meaning ‘sibling-in-law of the same sex’ be attributed to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_hipaR_?  Milke answered the first question by suggesting that ZH (w.s.) and HB were terminologically equated with the husband, and that BW (m.s.) and WZ were terminologically equated with the wife.  Whether such a system can be attributed to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) is unclear.  The evidence suggests that relative sex played a crucial role in definition of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_hipaR_ (as it did in the system of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) sibling terms).  The distribution of reflexes over major [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:MP) subgroups further suggests that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_hipaR_ probably meant ‘sibling-in-law of the same sex’ rather than ‘sibling-in-law of the opposite sex’, but an adequate reconstruction for the latter meaning remains to be found.",PMP,Canonical

The definite passive can occur in any of five aspects, of which the ""neutral definite passive"" is marked by _-an_, while the ""negatable neutral definite passive"" and the ""imperative definite passive"" are marked by _-i_.  The paradigmatic alternation of _-an_ and _-i_ thus appears to be common to at least [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) and [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244).  The present affix evidently is identical to what [Wolff (1973:73)](Source#cldf:wolff1973) called the ""local passive dependent"" construction.

[Starosta, Pawley, and Reid (1982:155)](Source#cldf:starostapawleyandreid1982) suggest that it derives from the generic locative marker &ast;_i_ which under certain conditions lost its prepositional function and was incorporated into the preceding verb in the separate histories of many Austronesian languages.  I concur with this interpretation, but note that it remains unexplained why the incorporation of such a preposition would not occur with intransitive as well as with transitive verbs.  


Judging from its widespread use as a verbal affix in [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages, it appears that the preposition &ast;_i_ had already become a suffix in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) (though at the same time it continued to function as a generic locative marker).  Because reflexes of &ast;_-i_ appear to be less common in non-[Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages, and because they sometimes co-occur with an active verb prefix (as in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427)), it seems likely the verbal functions of &ast;_-i_ in [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124) developed independently from those in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) -- in other words, that a suffix &ast;_-i_ ‘local transitive’, as distinct from the preposition &ast;_i_, did not exist in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) or [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP).  Moreover, in [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages the local transitive suffix &ast;_-i_ so commonly co-occurs with the incorporated 3sg. object pronoun &ast;_-a_ that the entire sequence &ast;_-ia_ (q.v.) must be posited as a functional unit for [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC).

26420,transitive and imperative suffix,pawley1973[120ff],*-ia,"[Pawley (1973:120ff)](Source#cldf:pawley1973) has suggested that this form contains two morphemes: 1. &ast;_-i_ ‘close transitive’ and &ast;_-a_ ‘3sg. object’.  As partial justification for this analysis he points out that reflexes of &ast;_-a_ are suffixed directly to the verb in Bauan Fijian and, under certain conditions, in other [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages such as [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) and [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396).  While this analysis may be correct, the combined form &ast;_-ia_ is so widely reflected in such similar functions that it can be reconstructed independently of &ast;_-i_ or &ast;_-a_.  


Two facts associated with this etymon appear especially noteworthy: 


(1) Apart from the well-known problems associated with the ""thematic"" consonant that surfaces before reflexes of &ast;_-ia_ in many languages, [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) and [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396) agree in showing surface _-ia_ only after stems that end in _a_; following stems that end in _e_, _i_, _o_, or _u_, the semantically similar surface form is _-a_ ([Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345): _ita-ia_ ‘to look at’, but _lare-a_ ‘to shoot an arrow’, _isi-a_ ‘to husk a coconut’, _hao-a_ ‘to awaken, arouse’, _utu-a_ ‘to draw water’; [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396): _asa-ia_ ‘to grind, as an axe’, _lage-a_ ‘to fix a parrot to a perch’, _gili-a_ ‘to tickle gently’, _tapo-a_ ‘to grope or feel for, as in the dark’, _vatua-_ ‘to give’).  I know of nothing which would produce such an agreement through convergence, and therefore assume that in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) there was an alternation between &ast;_-ia_, following stem-final &ast;_a_, and &ast;_-a_, following other stem-final vowels.  One or the other variant appears to have been generalized in various languages; for convenience the two will be referred to as &ast;_-ia_. 


(2) Reflexes of &ast;_-ia_ function both as transitive suffixes and as imperative markers in several widely separated [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages.  In Eastern Polynesian languages reflexes of &ast;_-ia_ typically mark passive constructions, and also appear in certain types of imperatives (those that imply a goal or object). This association of passive and imperative appears to closely parallel the association of passive and ‘polite’ imperative associated with reflexes of &ast;_-en_ ‘goal focus, direct passive focus’ in many [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages.  While no one has yet argued that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) had a passive construction marked by &ast;_-ia_, it apparently had an imperative construction marked in this manner.  The fact that the dual function of passive and imperative is associated with reflexes of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_-en_ in some [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages and with reflexes of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_-ia_ in some [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages raises the question whether the passive function of &ast;_-ia_ might be far older than PEP.",POC,Canonical

Although I believe that it is an improvement on Dempwolff, the cognate set proposed here is difficult for two reasons: (1) in most reflexes the proposed suffix &ast;_-an_ is fossilized (whereas the prefix &ast;_ka-_ in &ast;_ka-ibah-an_ is fossilized only in [Penan](LanguageTable#cldf:18658) _k-ivan_); (2) the meaning of reflexes ranges over ‘companion, friend’, same generation consanguines, same and adjacent generation affines, ‘clan’, and (at least in Philippine languages) ‘other, different’.  I assume that all of these senses are related through the notion ‘companion: the ""other"" in a personal dyad which includes the self’.  Dempwolff presumably would also have included forms that I assign to &ast;_iba iba_ ‘remainder, surplus’.  It is possible, but by no means certain,",PAN,Canonical

[Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _ka-ilán_, [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) _k-ilon_, Santa Catalina _ka-ita_ ‘when?’ may point to an additional affixed form &ast;_ka-ijan_.  In any event, it is clear that the initial consonant of [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) _kilon_ is a fossilized affix rather than evidence for &ast;_qijan_, since both [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](LanguageTable#cldf:18964) _a-ydan_ and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _ŋa-iʔan_ contradict initial &ast;_q_.  


The reconstruction of &ast;_p-ijan_ is problematic.  In many languages reflexes of &ast;_ijan_ are confused with reflexes of &ast;_pija_ ‘how much? how many?’ (see above), and it is possible that &ast;_p-ijan_ is a monomorphemic product of contamination.  Whatever the case, &ast;_p-_ does not appear to be separable in any [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) language.  Similarly, the great majority of [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages (like [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573)) reflect a form with prefixed &ast;_ŋa-_, suggesting that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_ŋaijan_ was monomorphemic.  Contrary to this interpretation, a few languages in the Solomons ([Mono-Alu](LanguageTable#cldf:19034), Santa Catalina) reflect &ast;_ijan_ without &ast;_ŋa-_.  Finally, both in [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) and in [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) a reflex of &ast;_ijan_ is commonly used together with a morpheme _nai_.  Attention to the glosses ([Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _nai_ ‘marker of past time’, [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _nai_ ‘where (relative), when (relative)’, however, suggests that this agreement is convergent, as apparently is that of [Buli](LanguageTable#cldf:249) _ma-fis_ ‘when (future)’, [Dobuan](LanguageTable#cldf:258) _ma-isa_ ‘when?’.",PAN,Canonical

 [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) &ast;_ijuŋ-an_ probably had meanings other than that reconstructed here, as is suggested by [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _ilóŋ-an_ ‘big nosed’, [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _ilúŋ-an_ ‘having a nicely-shaped nose’, [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _izuŋ-an_ ‘grow hard (rice grains)’, [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _iruŋ-an_ ‘pipe linking blacksmith's bellows to a fire-box; nose-shaped latch on a folding door’.

26507,perfective marker,wolff1973[];dahl1976[];starostapawleyandreid1982[],*<in>,"Both [Wolff (1973)](Source#cldf:wolff1973) and [Dahl (1976)](Source#cldf:dahl1976) reconstruct [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_-in-_ as a past tense marker which co-occurred with the active infix &ast;_-um-_, the instrumental passive &ast;_Si-_ and the local passive &ast;_-an_.  In the direct passive the relationship of &ast;_-in-_ to the verb is more complex.  Whereas the direct passive of non-past verbs was formed with &ast;_-en_, the direct passive of past verbs was formed with no suffix.  As a result the infix &ast;_-in-_ in the past tense of direct passive verbs acquired a kind of portmanteau function, signalling both the past tense and the passive voice inseparably.  This portmanteau function of &ast;_-in-_ is widespread in Austronesian languages, and was noted early in the 20th century by the Dutch linguist Hendrik Kern ([Kern 1913-28](bib-Kern)). 


 In contrast to Wolff and Dahl, [Starosta, Pawley, and Reid (1982)](Source#cldf:starostapawleyandreid1982) argue that &ast;_-in-_, along with other reconstructed affixes that function both as voice markers and as nominalizers in contemporary languages, were originally markers only of various types of nominalization.  To them it follows, then, that the widespread verbal uses of these affixes are historically secondary.  


In my view there is merit both in the position taken by Wolff and by Dahl (that the affixes in question were verbal inflections in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN)), and in the position taken by Starosta, Pawley, & Reid (that the same affixes were derivational devices for creating deverbal nouns).  If there is a shortcoming that is shared by the two approaches it is perhaps the implicit assumption that the [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) affixes &ast;_Si-_, &ast;_-in-_, &ast;_-an_, and &ast;_-en_ were _exclusively_ verbal or nominal. In fact, straightforward application of the comparative method seems to require the reconstruction both of verbs and of nouns marked with the same set of affixes in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN).  This leaves open the question whether at some still earlier period one of these functions might have developed out of the other. 

In [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) it is clear that at least pronominal agents (if not also nominal agents) and possessors were marked the same: e.g. [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_k-um-aen aku_ ‘I am eating’, but &ast;_kaen-en (ni) ku_ ‘is eaten by me, my eating’, &ast;_k-in-aen (ni) ku_ ‘was eaten by me, my eating’, &ast;_maCa (ni) ku_ ‘my eye’.  Given this identity of marking it would not be surprising for pattern pressure to favor the reinterpretation of non-AV verbal constructions as possessive nominals. Since no such pressure would favor the reinterpretation of possessive nominal constructions as non-AV verbals, I cannot agree with Starosta, Pawley, & Reid that the focus systems of modern [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) and Philippine languages probably evolved from earlier systems of nominalization.",PAN,Canonical

26533,one,,*isa₁,"The number ‘one’ is unique among numerals universally in that it alone tends to develop into an article.  Moreover, semantically the number ‘one’ carries something of the ""antithetical sense of primal words"" (to borrow a phrase from Freud): morphological derivatives in many languages refer both to unity (‘one with’) and to aloneness (‘one apart from’). The number ‘one’ is unique among Austronesian numerals in that it alone has reconstructed doublets (&ast;_esa_ and &ast;_isa_).  Moreover, in addition to these apparent stem variants a clitic form &ast;_sa-_ is found in some languages, including languages that lack the full numeral (e.g. [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _se-_ formative in _se-puluh_ ‘ten’, _se-ratus_ ‘100’, _se-ribu_ ‘1000’, etc., next to _satu_ ‘one’; [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _ha_ ‘indefinite article: a, an, some, any’, next to _taha_ ‘one’).  


The following additional points should be noted: 1. it is unclear whether &ast;_isaq_ should be treated as morphologically complex (&ast;_isa-q_) or as a doublet (&ast;_isaq_), 2. &ast;_ma-isa_ ‘alone’ appears to contain the stative or attributive prefix &ast;_ma-_; [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _mag-isá_ ‘be alone, do something alone’, however, suggests that [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) _maysá_ may reflect &ast;_maR-isa_.  Such an interpretation is not available for [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573), or [Yamdena](LanguageTable#cldf:1130), where &ast;_R_ did not regularly disappear, 3.  the nasal grade reflexes of &ast;_s_ (&ast;_insa_) in _Sulawesi_ and the Lesser Sunda islands are assumed to be a product of independent changes, 4. it is not clear whether a reflex of &ast;_esa_ or &ast;_isa_ survived in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC), although the clitic form &ast;_sa-_ evidently did.

The appropriateness of including some morphologically complex forms (as [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) _ma-issi_ and [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _paŋ-issi_) under &ast;_isi_ is questionable, but in these respects I have followed my sources.  Perhaps the most interesting feature of this comparison is its gloss.  


[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_isi_ with the rather bland meaning ‘contents’.  Abstract ideas generally have their foundations in sense perceptions, and we might therefore expect the idea of ‘contents’ to be rooted in something more concrete.  This is the case with &ast;_isiʔ_, which meant ‘flesh’ in addition to ‘contents’.  Moreover, it is clear from witnesses as diverse as [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395), and [Kei](LanguageTable#cldf:298) that ‘flesh’ must be taken in its broadest English sense: the meat of humans or animals (in contradistinction to the bone and fat) and the flesh of fruits (in contradistinction to the pit), or of vegetables.  


One recurrent reference to vegetable flesh is seen in [Kalamian Tagbanwa](LanguageTable#cldf:18285) _isi_ ‘flesh, meat; tuber’, [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) _isi_ ‘flesh without bones and fat; tuber’, [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) _talas isi-n_ ‘sweet potato roots’, _ubi isi-n_ ‘yam roots’, _isi-na ona_ ‘said when plants have produced tubers or when fruit is nearing maturity’, [Fordata](LanguageTable#cldf:18184) _ihi-n_ ‘flesh of tubers’, and the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) proverb _diam ubi ada-ña ber-isi_ ""resting like a tuber that puts on flesh by rest"" = recuperative and profitable rest.  


From this broad sense of ‘flesh’ it appears that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_isiʔ_ referred to the useful part of a thing, or its ""essence"".  Intriguingly, this notion is extended to the blade of a knife or the point of an arrow both in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) and in [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) languages, where the extended referential range of &ast;_isiʔ_ appears to have competed with that of &ast;_mata_ ‘eye; focal point; most prominent part’.  In a similar vein the arrow is the _isi_ of the bow in Soboyo, and the bullet the _isi_ of the gun in [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427).  


In striking contrast with semantic categories typical of Indo-European  languages (cf. e.g. [Buck 1949](Source#cldf:buck1949)), reflexes of &ast;_isiʔ_ also referred to humans in two related senses: (1) residents (the &ast;_isiʔ_ of the house), (2) inhabitants (= the &ast;_isiʔ_ of the land).  Finally, it is noteworthy that although [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_penuq_ meant ‘full (as a container)’, the common verb meaning ‘to fill’ evidently was not based on &ast;_penuq_, but rather on &ast;_isiʔ_.  The existential meanings of reflexes in [Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680), [Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243), and [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) are assumed to be products of convergence.",PAN,Canonical

At the same time it has caused considerable confusion to some comparativists.  [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) posited &ast;_ka_ ‘to eat’, &ast;_ka-en_ ‘what is to be eaten, food, nourishment’, on the assumption that &ast;_kaen_ contained a base &ast;_ka_ plus the patient suffix &ast;_-en_.  However, this is a misanalysis, as the comparative evidence supports &ast;_kaen_ ‘to eat’ and &ast;_kaen-en_ ‘be eaten by someone; what is to be eaten, food, nourishment’.  [Wolff (2010:855-856)](Source#cldf:wolff2010), on the other hand, posits &ast;_kan_ ‘eat’, but has no explanation for the second vowel (or for vowel length) in widely separated languages such as [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250), [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227), [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273), various Bisayan and Manobo languages, [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), [Tondano](LanguageTable#cldf:1077), [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245), [Totoli](LanguageTable#cldf:1084), [Boano](LanguageTable#cldf:544), [Banggai](LanguageTable#cldf:238) and [Proto-Bungku-Tolaki](LanguageTable#cldf:19187).  Moreover, following a prior suggestion by Dahl he proposes &ast;_isekan_ ‘fish’ as a morphological derivative, although the comparative evidence points clearly to [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) _&ast;Sikan_, with last-syllable &ast;_a_, not &ast;_e_ (cp. [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _iskan_ ‘fish’, vs. _kaʔun_ ‘eat’).  


The simplest explanation for these various confusions is that the base &ast;_kaen_ frequently contracted to a monosyllable because schwa next to another vowel is particularly weak, and tends to be absorbed.  This is especially the case with affixed forms, and an examination of almost any dictionary of a contemporary language shows that reflexes of the base &ast;_kaen_ rarely occur unaffixed, and that when they do they are more likely to retain the medial vowel sequence, as with [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226) _káon_ ‘to eat’, but _kán-on_ ‘rice, staple food’ (not &ast;&ast;_káon-on_).  Where &ast;_kaen_ has contracted to a monosyllable several languages independently have restored the favored disyllabism of content words through epenthesis, as in [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) _əkan_, [Yami](LanguageTable#cldf:1131) _(a)kan_, [Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246) _ek-ekan_, KADAD _akan_, or [Maloh](LanguageTable#cldf:327) _aŋkan_ ‘eat’ (the latter with subsequent sporadic medial prenasalization). 


 The rich morphology of this base is ubiquitous in Taiwan, the Philippines, northern Borneo and northern Sulawesi, but contracts radically in languages further to the south, where only paradigmatically dissociated elements remain, as in the Uma Juman dialect of [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294) ([Blust 1977:63-64](Source#cldf:blust1977)), where _kani_, _kanən_, _kinan_, _kuman_, _makan_, _pakan_, _pəŋanan_ and _pəŋuman_ are no longer anchored to a common base, and where most of the morphology in this fragmented paradigm is fossilized (_-ən_, _-in-_, _ma-_, _pa-_, _pəŋ-_ and _–an_ are otherwise unknown in the language, and although a reflex of &ast;_-um-_ continues to function as the marker of active voice, its form is _–əm-_, not _–um-_).  Similarly, for [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) [Hardeland (1859:276)](Source#cldf:hardeland1859) cites _kuman_ as a dictionary entry, and notes that “Das Passiv von _kuman_ is unregelmässig, heisst: _kinan_, gegessen, getrogen werden, (sind essbar).”",PAN,Canonical

As noted in [Blust (1987)](Source#cldf:blust1987) the most reasonable gloss for this challenging form is ‘men’s house’, that is, a dormitory for unmarried men.  According to [Fox (1993b:12)](Source#cldf:fox1993a) “This designation assumes, however, the existence of Melanesian type men’s houses among the early Austronesians prior to their contact with the non-Austronesian populations of New Guinea,” and he notes that “[Tryon (1993)](bib-Tryon), assigns &ast;_kalamiR_ the gloss, ‘granary, shed’.  It might therefore be appropriate to see the widespread [Western Malayo-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) reflexes as a retention and the usages found in Oceania as an innovation.” Quite apart from his repeated mis-citation of the form as &ast;_kalamiR_ (three times in a single 13-line paragraph), and his patently false assertion that “widespread [Western Malayo-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) reflexes” support the meaning ‘granary’, there are a number of problems with this statement.  First, Fox apparently fails to understand that &ast;_kamaliR_ must be reconstructed for [Proto-Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082), as this is the only gloss (apart from ‘man, male’ in the Admiralties) that reflexes of &ast;_kamaliR_ have in Oceanic languages.  But [Proto-Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) was spoken by a language community that had only recently arrived in the western Pacific, and that shows little influence from the Papuan languages that were already present in this region.  Second, in the context of the wider set of ‘house’ terms considered by [Blust (1987)](Source#cldf:blust1987) &ast;_lepaw_ is clearly a better [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) candidate for the meaning ‘granary’, as it is attested in this sense in both [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) and [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages, whereas &ast;_kamaliR_ is attested in this meaning only in the Philippines.  Third, a search through [Tryon (1995)](Source#cldf:tryon1995) turns up no reference to ‘granary shed’, and hence no data that was not already considered in [Blust (1987)](Source#cldf:blust1987).  Fourth, Fox’s suggestion that bachelor’s houses were unknown to Austronesian speakers prior to reaching New Guinea is fundamentally at odds with the ethnographic evidence, since the institution of bachelor’s houses has been described for inter alia, the Amis, Tsou, Rukai and Puyuma of Taiwan ([Chen 1988:271ff](Source#cldf:chen1988)), the Lepanto and Bontok of northern Luzon ([Keesing 1962:121](Source#cldf:keesing1962), [Lebar 1975:83](Source#cldf:lebar1975)), the Modang of east Kalimantan (Guerreiro 1998), the Acehnese of northern Sumatra ([Loeb 1972:221ff](Source#cldf:loeb1972)), the Mentaweians just west of Sumatra ([Lebar 1972:42](Source#cldf:lebar1972)), the prehispanic Chamorros, Palauans, and Yapese of western Micronesia ([Alkire 1977:21, 30ff, 33ff](Source#cldf:alkire1977)) ), the Ende of central Flores ([Lebar 1972:87](Source#cldf:lebar1972)), the Sika of east Flores ([Lebar 1972:89](Source#cldf:lebar1972)), the Solorese of east Flores and Adonara ([Lebar 1972:92](Source#cldf:lebar1972)), and the Tanimbarese of the southern Moluccas ([Lebar 1972:112](Source#cldf:lebar1972)).  Surprisingly, [Green and Pawley (1999:55ff)](bib-Green) adopt the same position, concluding that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_kamaliR_ meant ‘granary’ despite the fact that this meaning is attested only within the Philippine subgroup, that the Greater Central Philippine languages of Sulawesi reflect it in other meanings, as ‘palace’ ([Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245)), or ‘boat house’ ([Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), where, however, &ast;_R_ is reflected as /_r_/ instead of expected /_h_/), and that in some of the languages of northern Luzon, as [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289), _kamálig_ describes a sleeping place used “mostly in the daytime.”




In conclusion, the great semantic diversity of reflexes makes it difficult to confidently reconstruct a gloss for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_kamaliR_, but ‘men’s house’ seems by far the most plausible alternative, as special structures that serves both as dormitories for unmarried men and as men’s clubhouses are widely attested in traditional Austronesian-speaking societies, and [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_kamaliR_ could have had no other meaning.",PMP,Canonical

This comparison raises several questions. First, [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_iSu_ is already a well-established reconstruction for the 2sg independent pronoun, supported by at least a small subset of Formosan and Philippine languages. This has long raised the question what functional difference might have distinguished these two partially identical forms. [Blust (1977:8)](Source#cldf:blust1977) suggested that &ast;_i-kaSu_ was a polite substitute for &ast;_iSu_, and [Ross (2006:539-540)](bib-Ross) has tentatively accepted this interpretation, suggesting that it contains a prefix &ast;_ka-_ which has the same origin as the initial consonant of &ast;_k-ita_ ‘we pl. incl.’, &ast;_k-ami_ ‘we pl. excl.’ and the like. However, the appearance of [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _asu_ raises the prospect that the base might have been vowel-initial. 



Entirely apart from these issues, a few languages in Borneo, representing the Kenyah and Melanau groups, appear to retain a reflex of the medial consonant as glottal stop, although the expected _-h-_ in Philippine languages that retain this phoneme is nowhere present. Finally, in many languages the personal article &ast;_i_, used with first and second persons, has fossilized on the base, largely because _&ast;h_ tended to drop, and when the resulting sequence _–au_ resyllabified as _–aw_, it produced a monosyllabic content morpheme that is highly disfavored in most Austronesian languages. Note that [Sarawak Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:801) _kau_ appears to be disyllabic, and that the [Kenyah](LanguageTable#cldf:300), BERAW and Melanau forms, which retain a disyllabic reflex of the base, do not have a fossilized article attached. The fossilized article &ast;_i-_ appears to be rare in CMP languages, although [Lamboya](LanguageTable#cldf:19339) (western Sumba) _y-au_ regularly reflects [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_i-kahu_.

This form is semantically unusual in some languages, as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), where it carries an inherently passive sense without the need for passive morphology in constructions such as _mata saya kena abu_ ‘ashes got in my eye’ (my eye was struck by ashes), or _banyak anak-anak kena penyakit cacar_ ‘many children fell sick with smallpox.’  Given the glosses in some modern languages it seems likely that its basic meaning in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) was ‘be ensnared, caught in a trap’, the suddenness, unexpectedness, negativity, and non-agency of the event being essential experiential features that carry over to many other situations.  


Although my initial impulse was to separate the meanings relating to being struck or affected by forces beyond one’s control from those carrying the sense ‘true, correct’, it became apparent as more examples were collected that these meanings are extremes of a continuum in which the connecting link is ‘to hit the mark’ (= ‘get it right’).

One possible explanation for this discrepancy is borrowing from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326).  However, as the [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) word shows, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loans in Philippine languages normally come from the Brunei dialect, in which &ast;_e_ had already merged with &ast;_a_.  Moreover, as shown below, there is a pattern of reduplicated forms, most of which begin with &ast;_k_, representing the meanings ‘flicker, of flames; blinking, of eyes’ in many languages, thus increasing the probability that _kuráp-kuráp_ and _kəjəp kəjəp_ continue an inherited pattern.



The reduplication in this form is clearly iconic of the repetitive brightening and dimming of a flickering fire, a pattern that is also shown by unrelated forms that use reduplication to express the same meaning, as with [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _ag-kudre-kudrép_ ‘flicker’ (< _kudrép_ ‘dim; overcast; obscure; indistinct’), _ag-patáy-patáy_ ‘flicker’ (< _patáy_ ‘death’), [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _kimát-kimát_ ‘flickering, twinkling; shimmering; blinking; twitching’, _mag-kimát-kimát_ ‘to flicker, twinkle; to shimmer; to twitch or blink (the eye)’, [Mansaka](LanguageTable#cldf:825) _kilam-kilam_ ‘to sparkle; to flame; to flash; to glisten’, [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _kemat-kemat_ ‘flickering’, [Kiput](LanguageTable#cldf:18958) _kidəp- kidəp_ ‘to blink (involuntarily); to flicker, of flames’, [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) _kesap-kesap_ ‘blink, winking’, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _ter-kelip-kelip_ ‘twinkling; shimmering; blinking’, [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235) _kijap-kijep_ ‘blink the eyes’, [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _maʔ-millo-millo_ ‘to flicker, of a small flame’, etc.  The meanings ‘flicker’ and ‘blink’ are related through the rapid alternation of brightening and dimming, whether at the source of light, or at the source of perception.",PWMP,Canonical

 Both [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) _&ast;taqu_ and &ast;_kilala_ can be glossed by the English word ‘to know’.  However, &ast;_taqu_ evidently referred to the skill or practical understanding that results from acquired knowledge (as in what one needs to know in order to perform a job), and it is therefore understandably associated with dexerity and the right hand in various languages.  By contrast, &ast;_kilala_ evidently referred to instinctive or intuitive knowledge, as used in the passive recognition of people’s faces, or the acquisition of information through divination or the like.  Under most circumstances the formal similarity of the material cited here to [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _kilála_ ‘ornamental shrub, the reddish leaves of which have medicinal use: _Cordyline fruticosa_, would be passed over in silence.  However, reflexes of &ast;_kilala_ in the southeast Solomons refer to knowledge obtained by divination, and one of the charms used in divination is the leaves of dracaena, a close relative of the _Cordyline_, suggesting that this plant may have have been used for a similar purpose (knowledge through divination) in the pre-Christian Philippines, but that these associations were purged in the process of Christianization.

Most Formosan data cited here is from [Ross (2006)](bib-Ross).

However, in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages the reduction of &ast;_ni-kú_ to _-ŋku_ may have happened at different times across a wide range of languages, and it is therefore assumed that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) still had &ast;_ni-kú_).

This widely, if somewhat sparsely distributed comparison, provides the key linguistic evidence that a continuous tradition of pottery-making connects speakers of Proto-Austronesian, c. 5500-6000 BP with Pacific populations as far east as western Polynesia, about three millennia later.  In many areas pottery has been lost, and with it a term for ‘clay cooking pot’.  This is particularly true in the Pacific, including scattered areas in Melanesia and all of Polynesia, although it is clear that Proto-Polynesian speakers had pottery, and lost it within a few centuries of settling western Polynesia.  Pottery-making was also lost occasionally, but much less commonly, in insular Southeast Asia.  



For [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) aborigines, [Chen (1988:110)](Source#cldf:chen1988) reports the manufacture of pottery among the  [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250), [Tsou](LanguageTable#cldf:1087),  [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370), [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) and [Yami](LanguageTable#cldf:1131), adding that only the last two groups still made it in the late 1960s, but he does not distinguish cases in which there is positive evidence for its absence from cases in which it simply unreported.  Although pottery leaves perhaps the single most salient signature in the archaeological record of any item of material culture, owing both to its durability and its sheer quantity, the available linguistic evidence sheds no light on such centrally important archaeological topics as the origin of the Lapita decorative style.



In several Western Malayo-Polynesian languages, including  [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433), [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660),  [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235), Southern Toraja and  [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325), a reflex of &ast;_kuden_, either simple or affixed, refers not only to clay cooking pot, but also to such concepts as spouse, household, and the nuclear family.  These forms suggest that the clay cooking pot  almost certainly the vessel in which rice was boiled for the daily meal  became a metaphor of commensality, and hence of the union of man and wife in the nuclear family unit.",PAN,Canonical

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_lahud_ was one of the key directional terms in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN), opposed to &ast;_daya_ ‘upstream, toward the interior’.  In many languages this term has since been reinterpreted in terms of a system of cardinal directions, probably through Western contact influence.  The general semantic evolution of &ast;_lahud_ is quite rich.  From an original narrow sense ‘toward the sea’ the marine element has been generalized to mean ‘sea’ in Central Philippine languages generally ([Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244), [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226), [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252), etc.), [Binukid](LanguageTable#cldf:19012), the Malayic languages, [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235), [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), [Buginese](LanguageTable#cldf:239), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678), [Hawu](LanguageTable#cldf:405), [Wetan](LanguageTable#cldf:1118),  and [Tolai](LanguageTable#cldf:19416). Although [Topping, Ogo and Dungca (1975)](bib-Topping) give only the cardinal direction meanings, Brant 
Songsong assures me that this word still retains its sense of ‘toward the sea’, as in the expression _lagu para i tasi_, said regardless of which cardinal direction the sea might be from a given location.





Moreover, in some of these languages, as those of the central Philippines, it refers specifically to the high or open seas as opposed to littoral waters.  In other languages, especially those whose speakers came to reside in high inland regions, the contrastive elevation of &ast;_lahud_ was extended to encompass the general meaning of ‘lower, at a lower altitude’, in some cases entirely losing its marine associations.  In [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) of central Taiwan, for example,  _raus_ refers to a downhill, or downward direction from the mountains, with no particular reference to the sea, in [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) of the north-central Philippines _láwud_ refers to the lowland regions, but so far as the available data indicate, not necessarily to the sea, and in [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236)  (or Pamona) of central Sulawesi _lau_ refers to any place that lies lower than the speaker at the time of reference, evidently with no connection to the sea as a feature of orientation.  


Finally, [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _olo laut_, [Hawu](LanguageTable#cldf:405) _dou lou_ and no doubt similar collocations in other languages for which insufficient data is to hand suggest that once settled in a given location, AN speakers tended to conceive of anyone who arrived by sea as a foreigner, or stranger.",PAN,Canonical

Reconstruction of this word raises several formal issues, and suggests cultural practices that reach beyond linguistic reconstruction.



[Dyen (1947, 1953)](bib-Dyen) posited [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_leyqa_ ‘ginger’ in order to account for the penultimate vowel of forms such as [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _luyʔá_, but this proposal confuses an innovative doublet &ast;_luqia_ in Proto-Greater Central Philippines with reflexes of &ast;_laqia_. Apart from these deviant forms, a number of languages have disyllabic words that appear to reflect &ast;_lia_. In some cases ([Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299), [Kenyah](LanguageTable#cldf:300), [Bintulu](LanguageTable#cldf:242), [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), etc.) these can be derived by regular change from &ast;_laqia_ through reduction of the first-syllable vowel to schwa, which then deleted along with the following glottal stop, but in Oceanic languages such as [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307) or [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945)  this does not work, and forms such as [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307) _lia_ or [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945) _lie_ must therefore be regarded either as irregular reductions of &ast;_laqia_, or as evidence for a possible doublet &ast;_lia_. 



The cultural role of ginger is particularly interesting.  Apart from its use as a condiment in cooking, the glosses in several languages show that this plant was used for medicinal purposes from an early time.  In this function it evidently was chewed and spewed with saliva onto the afflicted part, as shown in the glosses for [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) and [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) _lia_. Similar descriptions appear in ethnographic accounts.  [Fortune (1963:295)](Source#cldf:fortune1963), for example, notes that among the Dobuans of western Melanesia sorcerors regularly chew ginger and spray it out in practicing sorcery as well as curative medicine: “It is chewed with many healing incantations, apart from the tabu exorcisms which are breathed into water for bathing the patient.  With other healing spells it is spat on the seat of illness.  The sight of a magician chewing ginger, spitting it onto the object charmed at intervals, and muttering his spell at the same time is a common one at Dobu … It is chewed in all the incantations to ward off a squall at sea and spat towards the lowering squall.  It is chewed and bespattered over the canoe, in lashing it with incantation, making it speedy and seaworthy…”.



The puzzling [Lakalai](LanguageTable#cldf:877) gloss, which combines ginger with prowess as a warrior is further illuminated by remarks in [Codrington (1972:133)](Source#cldf:codrington1972) regarding cultural practices on the island of Florida in the central Solomons.  A man who is about to go out on a vendetta against his private enemy “will pull up his ginger-plant, and judge from the ease with which it comes out of the earth whether he shall succeed or not; he will make his sacrifice, and with the ginger and leaves on his shield and in his belt and right armlet will go to fight.”  As in Dobu, a curer (195) “will chew ginger and blow into the patient’s ears and on that part of the skull which is soft in infants, will call on the name of the _tindalo_, (ghost) and beg him to remove the sickness.”



Judging from the glosses in [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) and [Kei](LanguageTable#cldf:298) in eastern Indonesia ginger provided a stimulant for various kinds of purposes.  In particular it evidently was given to dogs to make them more vigorous in hunting.  The gloss in [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) and the above quote from Fortune on the Dobuans suggest that it was also chewed and spat upon inanimate objects, as a fishing net or canoe to make them more efficacious.  These varied uses are all perhaps united by a common thread: given its stimulating taste ginger evidently was conceived as a plant that could impart vitality to other objects, either when chewed and expectorated upon them, as in healing or improving the efficacy of tools such as nets or canoes, or when fed directly to an animal, as in improving the hunting acuity of dogs.  When used to confront something negative, as a storm, its supposed supernatural powers act to counter the undesirable effects.",PMP,Canonical

I have posited several morphologically complex forms of &ast;_laRiw_, although a distinctive meaning is not always apparent for these, as with &ast;_ma-laRiw_.  The form &ast;_pa-laRiw_ requires special comment, as its reflexes have survived in some languages when a reflex of &ast;_laRiw_ has not.  In languages such as [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433), [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124) and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP)), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) ([CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP)), and [Numfor](LanguageTable#cldf:364) ([South Halmahera-West New Guinea](LanguageTable#cldf:SHWNG)), the morpheme boundary that is recognized is purely historical, and is marked by = to distinguish it from the similar synchronic morpheme boundary in forms such as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _lari_, _pe-lari_. 


It is an interesting question why the morpheme boundary should have been lost more commonly in reflexes of &ast;_pa-laRiw_ than in reflexes of other morphologically complex forms of &ast;_laRiw_.  One might argue that affixes differed in how tightly they were bound to the stem.  However, this should be generally true and not specific to particular lexical items.  Moreover, just what tightness of binding might mean is obscure except in terms of text frequency.  Perhaps &ast;_pa-laRiw_ occurred with particularly high text frequency because it not only signaled the abstract notion of flight or escape, but also the actor (""fugitive; one who has eloped"").  In some descendants of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) reflexes of &ast;_pa-laRiw_ may have occurred with higher text frequency than reflexes of &ast;_laRiw_, thus favoring the survival of the bi-morphemic word even when the stem itself passed out of use.",PAN,Canonical

The other options that appear viable are ‘field hut’, a meaning that shows up in several of the languages of Borneo, and ‘rice granary’, a meaning that shows up in several of the languages of Borneo, and in [Atoni](LanguageTable#cldf:231) of west Timor.

Both ‘field hut’ and ‘granary’ also occur with reflexes of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;sapaw, but the distribution of meanings across major subgroups clearly favors &ast;_sapaw_ in the meaning ‘field hut’.  Reflexes in [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) and [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294) raise the prospect that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_lepaw_ could have referred both to field huts (when unqualified) and to granaries (when qualified by a word for ‘rice’).  However, since this inference is not supported by converging lines of evidence from both WMP and CMP languages it is best treated as a speculation.  The similar semantic profiles of &ast;_lepaw_ and &ast;_sapaw_ strongly suggest that rice granaries were simple structures that did not differ significantly from field huts which were used for temporary residence when working in the fields away from the village for several days in succession.",PAN,Canonical

Based on the comparison [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _lindól_ : [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _linḍu_ ‘earthquake’, [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_linḍuγ_ ‘earthquake’, but he was forced to acknowledge that the sound correspondence supporting the final consonant is irregular, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) pointing to &ast;_lindul_ or &ast;_lindur_, but [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) to &ast;_lindu_ or &ast;_linduR_ (ignoring the &ast;_d_/_ḍ_ distinction, which is no longer regarded as valid).  Access to apparently related forms from a much larger selection of languages now permits the reconstruction of both &ast;_linduR_ and the disjunct &ast;_lindur_, although neither of these is a competitor of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_linuR_ ‘earthquake’.  At first glance [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _luni_ and Philippine forms such as [Agta (Central Cagayan)](LanguageTable#cldf:465), [Balangaw](LanguageTable#cldf:509) _lunig_ suggest a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) doublet &ast;_luniR_, but closer attention to northern Luzon forms indicates that they probably reflect &ast;_lunij_. This in turn allows comparison with [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _rinuz_ (< &ast;_linuj_), except that the position of the vowels is reversed and there is no clear basis for deciding which order was original.  In addition, [Li (1981)](Source#cldf:li1981) has posited [Proto-Atayalic](LanguageTable#cldf:19073) &ast;_gunug_ ‘earthquake’ on the basis of evidence that actually supports [Proto-Atayalic](LanguageTable#cldf:19073) &ast;_runug_, a form which would reflect earlier &ast;_lunuR_.

In addition to reflexes that conform to expectation this list shows that there is a surprising number of apparently related forms that do not.  Some of these might be taken as evidence for doublets, as [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _lúsaʔ_, [Loniu](LanguageTable#cldf:321) _lus_ < [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_lusehaq_, or [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) _liyas_, [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294) _liah_, [Mori Atas](LanguageTable#cldf:19280) _liʔoho_ < [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_liqesah_. However, the evidence for a variant &ast;_lusehaq_ currently seems too tenuous to take seriously, and apparent reflexes of &ast;_liqesah_ are probably best treated as products of convergent metathesis.  Forms such as [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _lioso_, [Mori Atas](LanguageTable#cldf:19280) _liʔoho_ also suggest that the merger of &ast;_e_ (schwa) and &ast;_a_ before a final laryngeal had not yet taken place in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) (hence [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_liseheq_/_liseqeh_).  However, since all other languages point to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_-aq_ or &ast;_-ah_ in this form, and a similar merger is supported by other etymologies, I will assume that the second rounded vowel in these Sulawesian forms is a product of assimilation to the regular reflex of &ast;_e_ in penultimate position.  


Finally, several widely separated languages ([Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175), [Yakan](LanguageTable#cldf:1129), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Komodo](LanguageTable#cldf:708), plus the irregular [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) form _ku-licca_) reflect the base reconstructed here with a prefix &ast;_ku-_ of unknown function.

Finally, Dempwolff noted [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _luja_ ‘spittle (after it is expectorated)’ as an irregular reflex of &ast;_ludaq_, but this can now be assigned to a tentative [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) doublet &ast;_luzaq_ based only on evidence from languages either currently spoken in Borneo ([Kanowit](LanguageTable#cldf:290), [Ba’amang](LanguageTable#cldf:18939), [Kapuas](LanguageTable#cldf:687)) or historically deriving from Borneo (Sama-Bajaw), but not subgrouping closely together.",PAN,Canonical

30830,"eye, focal point, center or most prominent part",blust2009[313-314];blust2011[],*maCa,"As shown in [Blust (2009:313-314)](Source#cldf:blust2009) reflexes of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_maC_a are exceptionally rich in their extended meanings.  Although its primary sense clearly was ‘eye’, this term, like its semantic equivalents in many of the world’s languages, simultaneously indicated an idea that can be characterized roughly as ‘focal point, most prominent or important part’, a sense that is realized in particular instances as ‘sun’, ‘budding part of a plant’, ‘spring of water’, ‘blade or point of a knife’, and the like.  



In many cases the semantic structure of such words persists even when the morphemes that express it are not cognate, as in [Tunjung](LanguageTable#cldf:1091) _ue_ ‘eye’, _au_ ‘day’, _ue-n-au_ ‘sun’ (‘eye of the day’), [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _mata hari_ ‘sun’ (‘eye of the day’), [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _mata ni ari_ ‘sun’ (‘eye of the day’), or [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _mata-m balal_ ‘sun’ (‘eye of the day’).  



In others the semantics are slightly skewed, as in [Sebop](LanguageTable#cldf:997) _atə-n_ ‘eye’, _laŋit_ ‘sky’, _atə-n laŋit_ ‘sun’ (‘eye of the sky’).  Some ‘eye’ expressions are extremely widespread in Austronesian languages, as those for ‘sun’, ‘nipple of the breast’, ‘spring of water’, and the like, while others are confined to a single language or discrete subgroup, as with Polynesian forms for ‘raindrop’ that reflect Proto-Polynesian &ast;_mata ʔuha_.  The range of metaphorical or quasi-metaphorical extensions of ‘eye’ given here is no doubt incomplete, but should serve to indicate the exceptional richness of abstract uses for this body-part, a richness that derives universally from the eye as the first part of the human anatomy on which infants focus, and which therefore becomes for all humans a focal point for anything important or essential ([Blust 2011](Source#cldf:blust2011)).



The use of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_nu_ as the genitive marker in expression such as &ast;_mata nu susu_ ‘nipple of the breast’ or &ast;_mata nu wahiR_ ‘spring of water, source of a river’ might be questioned, since most of the languages for which these expressions have been recorded have no genitive marker, and --- with few exceptions --- those that do have a form of the genitive that is different from &ast;_nu_.  However, other evidence indicates that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) had three genitive markers: &ast;_nu_ ‘genitive of common nouns’, &ast;_ni_ ‘genitive of singular personal nouns’ and &ast;_na_ ‘genitive of plural personal nouns’, and this would lead us to expect that the marker in ‘eye’ constructions would have been &ast;_nu_, even if no trace of it is preserved in the languages cited here.  [Proto-Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082), on the other hand, evidently replaced &ast;_nu_ with &ast;_ni_, as this is consistently reflected in different primary branches of the Oceanic subgroup ([Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359), [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307), [Ulawa](LanguageTable#cldf:1095), [Gilbertese](LanguageTable#cldf:614), [Wayan](LanguageTable#cldf:19060), [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266)).",PAN,Canonical

Although Dempwolff's morphological analysis almost certainly is correct, it is complicated by the virtual absence of known reflexes of the unaffixed base.  


Two candidates supporting a bimorphemic analysis are known to me: 1. [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](LanguageTable#cldf:18964) _ma-iRa_, _i-ka-iRa_ ‘ashamed’, 2. [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) _hígaʔ_ ‘type of crab having red eyes’.  Both of these candidates for the unaffixed base are problematic, the [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) form because it contains an unexpected zero reflex of &ast;_-q_, the [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) form because it is unique in the _Philippines_.

Reflexes of &ast;_maliraŋ_ show a distribution which is difficult to explain as a product of borrowing.

If its original sense included not only protection from the sun, but also protection from wind and rain the meaning ‘lee of an island’, which is attested both in [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) of the southeast Solomons, and in [Nukuoro](LanguageTable#cldf:363) may also have been associated with this form in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC).",PEMP,Canonical

The basic sense of this term was clearly ‘to chew something that one does not intend to swallow’.  In island Southeast Asia the usual application is to chewing betel nut, but what may be an older usage is widespread in Oceanic languages and appears occasionally farther west, and that is the practice of premasticating food for an infant (sometimes applied to the habit of birds in regurgitating food for nestlings, but more commonly applied to humans).

27183,linker marking emphatic attribution,,*na₂,"Both &ast;_a_ and &ast;_na_ must be reconstructed as linkers between [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) nominal heads and their lexical or phrasal attributes.  The question naturally arises what relationship these forms had.  In some attested languages ([Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244)) _na_ is one of two phonologically conditioned allomorphs of a single morpheme, and it is conceivable that a similar relationship existed for [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_a_ and &ast;_na_.  


What is striking about the distribution of these forms is that outside _Taiwan_ reflexes have never been reported in the same language (thus some languages reflect &ast;_a_, while others reflect &ast;_na_). However, in [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) of central _Taiwan_ reflexes of both &ast;_a_ and &ast;_na_ are found as fully functional linkers.  While native speakers insist that _a_ and _na_ are ‘the same’, grammaticality judgements for phrases which contain one or the other particle show that they are not fully interchangeable.  In a handful of critical examples it is reasonably clear that _a_ signals what might be called ‘neutral’ or ‘unmarked’ attribution (e.g. _ma-tubu a saran_ ‘a wet road’ = ‘wet LINK road’, while _na_ signals what might be called ‘contrastive’ or ‘emphatic’ attribution (e.g.  Q: ‘which road did you come on?’, A: _ma-tubu na saran_ ‘the WET road’).  Since [van der Tuuk (1971 [1864-1867])](bib-van) also treats the [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) linker or relativizer _na_ as an ‘emphasizer’ it appears likely that the situation in [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) is conservative, reflecting a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) distinction which has been lost in almost all other Austronesian languages.",PAN,Canonical

As such it signalled both possessors and non-subject agents.  This dual function was retained in most Philippine-type languages in Taiwan, the Philippines and northern Borneo, as well as in the Batak languages of northern Sumatra, and indirectly through the genitive suffix &ast;_-ña_ (< &ast;_ni-á_) in [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573), and in western Indonesian languages that have reduced the four-voice system of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) to a simple active-passive dichotomy, as in [Bintulu](LanguageTable#cldf:242) of Borneo, or [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326).

Two other observations about this data set seem noteworthy.  The first is that the coconut was used for ceremonial purposes in a traditional context, including healing rituals (cf. glosses in [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282), [Gedaged](LanguageTable#cldf:269), [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307), [Toqabaqita](LanguageTable#cldf:19197), ['Āre'āre](LanguageTable#cldf:18004), and [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390) The second is that the nipa palm (_Nipa fruticans_) is recurrently referenced through a reflex of &ast;_niuR_ (reflexes in [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), ['Āre'āre](LanguageTable#cldf:18004),  and [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485)), even though a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) reconstruction (&ast;_nipa_) clearly must be posited.",PMP,Canonical

 It is unclear whether this morpheme could occur in isolation in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN), since such reflexes as [Melanau Dalat (Kampung Kekan)](LanguageTable#cldf:576) _new_ ‘what?’ could be products of secondary reduction.  &ast;_-nuh_ was a formative in many interrogative words, but apparently was not an interrogative marker itself, as there is no comparative evidence that it could be used to transform declarative into interrogative expressions.

The search for a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) term for ‘squid’ is frustrating, since there are many words with this meaning that show greater than chance phonetic similarity, but few that exhibit recurrent sound correspondences, a situation that obtains even within the Oceanic group ([Blust 1978:147](Source#cldf:blust1978), [Ross 1988:342, 344](Source#cldf:ross1988)).  [Pawley (2011)](Source#cldf:pawley2011) reconstructs [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_nusa_ (doublet &ast;_nus_) ‘small reef squid (_Loligo_ spp.) and smaller cuttlefish (_Sepia_ spp.)’.  While the longer of these doublets is clearly justified, it is the shorter one that appears a priori to have possible cognates outside the Oceanic group.  All of the forms cited in the above comparison can reflect &ast;_nues_, but it is not at all clear that such a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) etymon existed.  Oceanic forms such as [Kairiru](LanguageTable#cldf:667) _nus_ ‘squid’, [Mbula](LanguageTable#cldf:815) _nus_ ‘squid type (smaller-sized), [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394) _nū_ ‘squid, small type of cuttlefish’ initially appear to be related, but the first of these is better accounted for by [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_nuso_ ‘smaller types of reef squid’, and the regular reflex of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_nues_ in [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394) would be &ast;&ast;__nuo__.  Forms in the Admiralty islands which appear to reflect an earlier monosyllable clearly indicate &ast;_ñ_ as the initial consonant, thus conflicting with the evidence of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573), all of which point unambiguously to &ast;_n_,  Adding to the difficulty of Pawley’s (2011) [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_nus_ ‘squid’ is the extreme rarity (one might even say non-existence) of reconstructed content words at the [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) level or higher which are monosyllabic.  Finally, additional doublets could be reconstructed based on very slender evidence, as with [Pak](LanguageTable#cldf:371) _nuy_, [Gedaged](LanguageTable#cldf:269) _nui_, [Manam](LanguageTable#cldf:328) _nuri_ < &ast;_nuRi_, or [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _núkus_, [Binukid](LanguageTable#cldf:19012) _nukus_, [Loniu](LanguageTable#cldf:321) _ñuk_ < &ast;_ñukus_, but as noted in [Blust (1978:147)](Source#cldf:blust1978) given the generally chaotic comparative picture presented by phonetically similar but non-corresponding forms beginning with a reflex of &ast;_nu-_, &ast;_ñu-_ or occasionally &ast;_ŋu-_, this temptation is best resisted.",PMP,Canonical

30334,iron (metal),tsuchida1982[];blust1996[283-288];blust1976[];chen1988[146],*Namat,"This is a critically important comparison that should be considered in conjunction with &ast;_diNaŋ_ ‘rust’.  According to [Tsuchida (1982)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1982) in May, 1917 the form _tamat_ was recorded by an unnamed Japanese colonial policeman from one of the last speakers of [Taokas](LanguageTable#cldf:19210), which soon after became extinct.  This material was then transferred to the pioneering Formosan linguist Naoyoshi Ogawa, where it remained in his notebooks until it was rediscovered in recent decades.  No other reflex of &ast;_Namat_ is known, and there are essentially two reasonable explanations for this distribution.  One is that the word is a loan from [Taokas](LanguageTable#cldf:19210) to [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) or vice-versa (or perhaps from an intermediate language that has since lost it, such as the inadequately known Liulang).  Within modern times [Taokas](LanguageTable#cldf:19210) and [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) have not been in contact, and they are separated by a considerable mountain massif now peopled by speakers of [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) However, there is some evidence that the Atayalic peoples have moved northward into their present territory within the past few centuries ([Blust 1996:283-288](Source#cldf:blust1996)), and it is thus possible that prior to the Atayal reaching their historically attested distribution the Taokas had a wider east-west territorial spread than they had when linguistic and ethnographic recording in this part of Taiwan began during the Japanese colonial period starting in 1895.  




The second explanation, of course, is that these terms are simply the last relics of a word that was used by the original Austronesian settlers of Taiwan in the period 5,500-6,000 BP.  Since known reflexes of &ast;_diNaŋ_ ‘rust’ are restricted to [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) and [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370), where borrowing is effectively not an issue, this second explanation for reflexes of &ast;_Namat_ seems clearly to be favored.  The issue of early Austronesian knowledge and possible use of iron has come up before in conjunction with a different set of comparisons ([Blust 1976, 1999](Source#cldf:blust1976)), with the strongest evidence pointing to a language ancestral to those in at least the Philippines and western Indonesia, but not Taiwan.  The evidence for &ast;_diNaŋ_ ‘rust’ and &ast;_Namat_ ‘iron’ pushes the inferences for knowledge of iron back to the earliest stages of reconstructed history in the Austronesian language family.  Given the predominant view among archaeologists and other scholars that use of the iron is a relatively late development in island Southeast Asia these linguistic comparisons are sure to come under fire.  However, both comparisons are firmly established, and they provide two independent lines of evidence leading to the same conclusion.  In discussing the material culture of the Formosan aborigines [Chen (1988:146)](Source#cldf:chen1988) rather matter-of-factly notes that “Spears are used by all tribes,” and he describes a wide variety of spears and harpoons, all of which have iron heads.  He also notes that arrowheads were commonly made of iron, but he provides no information of any kind on metallurgy in general, or the process of making iron points for spears or arrows in particular, and we are not told whether the earliest Chinese reports on the aborigines noted that they were using iron-tipped arrows and spears.  However, given the two independent pieces of linguistic evidence cited here it seems clear that anyone wishing to understand the culture history of the Austronesian-speaking peoples must give serious consideration to the possibility that iron was used on Taiwan for the manufacture of at least arrow and spear/harpoon heads from a far earlier time than is commonly accepted.  Whether this continued after the Austronesian migration to the Philippines and beyond is a distinct question.

The basic meaning of this term evidently was ‘cleared land in a village’ (as opposed to jungle/bush), with specific reference to the cleared area around a house, or the village square used as a meeting place.

This reconstruction is somewhat tentative, since the inclusion of [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) _ka-lhib_ depends on a morpheme division of somewhat dubious status, and without the [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) form the word is attested only in languages that are geographically contiguous, hence raising the prospect of borrowing, a possibility that is strengthened by the apparent borrowing of a dialectal [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) form into [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293).  In favor of maintaining the comparison, on the other hand, are the observation that medial consonant clusters in [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) always reflect earlier sequences in which an intervening vowel has dropped, and the appearance of an unexplained _ka-_ on a number of other nouns, as [Saisiyat (Taai)](LanguageTable#cldf:977) _ka-kliw_ (< &ast;_keRiw_) ‘hemp’, _kæ-ʔLor_ ‘pillar’ (< &ast;_qelud_ ‘main house post’, _ka-sbol_ (< &ast;_CebuN_) ‘smoke’, and _ka-tboʃ_ (< &ast;_tebuS_) ‘sugarcane’.  


Given the specific agreements between [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) and [Paiwan (Western)](LanguageTable#cldf:18972) the meaning seems clearly to have been ‘rock shelter, cave under an overhanging rock’ rather than simply ‘cave’.  We can only wonder why such a feature of the natural landscape was deemed sufficiently important to be lexically encoded in a unique way, but it is possible that such natural shelters were frequently used by the indigenous population of hunter-gatherers (bearers of the palaeolithic Ch’angpinian archaeological culture) who were encountered by Austronesian-speakers when they arrived in Taiwan, and who disappeared from the island within centuries of that event.",PAN,Canonical

However, numerous other words for this meaning contain a reflex of [&ast;-pis₂](root-acd-r_p.htm#-pis₂), as [Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) _halipit_ ‘thin’, [Amis (Kiwit)](LanguageTable#cldf:19260) _kuhpits_ ‘thin’, [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _ɬusepit_ ‘be thin (as paper)’, [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _inpis_ ~ _impis_ ‘thin (like paper)’, [Yami](LanguageTable#cldf:1131) _ma-taripis_ ‘thin (as a board)’, [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _iŋpít_ ‘thin, tenuous (paper, plates, strings, etc.)’, as well as others that mimic the same root, as with [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _ma-nisbis_ ‘thin’ ([Ferrell 1969](Source#cldf:ferrell1969)), or [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](LanguageTable#cldf:18964) _a-RipiT_ ‘thin, as a board or the arm’.  Given this rampant variation on a common theme there is no special reason to assume that [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) _lihpih-an_ reflects &ast;_Nipis_ rather than being just another innovation that contains a reflex of the root [&ast;-pis₂](root-acd-r_p.htm#-pis₂).",PAN,Canonical
30583,breath; to breathe,tsuchida1976[229],*NiSawa,"Also [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _gi-nʔáwa_ ‘relief, comfort, ease, rest, relaxation’ (< [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423)?), [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920) _nawá_ ‘have sufficient space, time, etc.’, [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) _gi-nháwaʔ_ ‘body, including internal organs, respiratory tract, brain, etc.’, [Masbatenyo](LanguageTable#cldf:19186) _mag-gi-nháwaʔ_ ‘breathe, respire, take breaths’, _gi-nhawaʔ-án_ ‘respiratory system’, [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225) _ñawɔŋ_ ‘the personal soul, life-force’, [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _gina_ ‘breath; mind, heart, nature, disposition, feelings; condition, health; thoughts; meaning’, _mo-gina_ ‘to breathe’, [Uma](LanguageTable#cldf:19170) _inohaʔ_ ‘breath’, [Buli](LanguageTable#cldf:249) _ñawa_ ‘soul; life; breath’ (< [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326)).  



This is a challenging comparison, both formally and semantically.  Forms with _gi-_ appear to be a Greater Central Philippine innovation that spread into [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) (more recently) and into the languages of Sabah (more anciently).  It is unclear whether [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920) _li-náwa_ shares the same history (from &ast;_Ri-nihawa_), or is a product of convergence.  If it shares the same history then &ast;_Ri-hinawa_ must be posited for [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh), raising questions about the absence of &ast;_Ri-_ in other non-Greater Central Philippine languages.  For this reason I tentatively assume that the _li-_ of [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920) _li-náwa_ is unrelated to the _gi-_ of Central Philippine forms such as [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _gi-nháwa_.



It would be easy to reconstruct [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_ñawa_ and ignore the Philippine and Sulawesian forms that point to an original trisyllable, but the highly distinctive semantic agreement of [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _hinawa_ ‘breath, respiration’, or [Tombonuwo](LanguageTable#cldf:19188) _inawo_ ‘soul’ with disyllables such as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _ñawa_ ‘life in its association with the breath; soul’ strongly suggests that we are dealing with a single cognate set.  Since most AN languages reflect a form in which &ast;_i_ must have followed &ast;_n_ rather than preceding it I reconstruct &ast;_nihawa_, a trisyllable that is supported by [Yakan](LanguageTable#cldf:1129) _niyawa_, [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) _niawa_, and many languages that appear to reflect an original &ast;_ñawa_. Unless we posit doublets &ast;_nihawa_, &ast;_hinawa_ this unavoidably implies an independent metathesis in e.g. [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _hinawa_, [Tombonuwo](LanguageTable#cldf:19188) _inawo_, [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _inaa_, [Muna](LanguageTable#cldf:350) _inawa_, and what appears to be a secondary metathesis in Greater Central Philippine forms such as [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _gi-nháwa_ (with syncopated &ast;_i_ in the environment VC__CV).  



The reconstruction proposed here differs from that of [Tsuchida (1976:229)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976), who posited [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) _&ast;ñiSawa_ with an initial palatal nasal, but also reconstructed &ast;_N-_ in other forms.  However, there are problems with this proposal.  First, very little evidence has been found to support the claim that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_N_ and &ast;_ñ_ were distinct phonemes.  Second, the sound correspondences between [Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680) and [Saaroa](LanguageTable#cldf:974) that Tsuchida took to support &ast;_ñ_ are violated by [Saaroa](LanguageTable#cldf:974) in this case (in showing /_n_/ rather than /_ɬ_/).  Third, most instances of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_N_ clearly became [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_n_, and given a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) palatal nasal we would expect the [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) form to be &ast;&ast;__-iñawa__, not _–inawa_ (note that the [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124) variant _iñawa_ is also irregular, and is best seen as a sporadic palatalization of n by the preceding high vowel).



Reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) _&ast;nihawa_ are particularly interesting in providing one of the rare examples of a phonemic palatal nasal arising from a sequence of &ast;_n_ + _ia_, much like [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN)/[PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_ni-á_ ‘3sg. genitive’ > [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_-ña_ ‘3sg possessor’.  What is unknown is how many parallel innovations of the form _&ast;nihawa_ > _niawa_ > _ñawa_ must be assumed in order to account for the data in terms that are compatible with currently accepted subgrouping hypotheses.  It is clear, for example, that the reanalysis of &ast;_nihawa_ to &ast;_-ñawa_ was already complete in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_mañawa_, parallel to the reanalysis of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_ni-á_ to [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_-ña_ ‘3sg possessor’, but languages such as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) evidently developed a palatal nasal in this form through an independent change that followed the same evolutionary path.



Finally, the semantics of &ast;_nihawa_ provide a reminder of the universality of animism, as first clearly stated by [Tylor (1871)](bib-Tylor): from the notion ‘breath; to breathe’ there is a link to the ‘breath soul’, and from this to ‘soul; inner self, mind, feelings’, but in another direction to ‘breathe easily, take a break, rest’.  Although it may initially appear to be adventitious, the recurrent reference to the fontanel links to the widespread traditional belief that the soul exits the body in dreams or death through the fontanel/top of the head (also clearly linked to the pulsation of breathing in an infant’s still-forming skull).",PAN,Canonical

Some writers, as [English (1986)](Source#cldf:english1986) treat this as a borrowing of Spanish _palo_ ‘stick, cudgel’, but cognates outside the Philippines, and the occasional use of this word as a verb meaning ‘hit with the fists’ suggest that the similarity between Spanish _palo_ and forms in Philippine languages is due to chance.

Apart from the Javanese form cited here, Dempwolff compared [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _naik_ ‘rise, climb (as the price of something), increase’, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _naik_ ‘motion up.

The [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) form could be a back-formation from &ast;&ast;_memenaik-i_ (reduced to attested _menaik-i_ by haplology, then interpreted as deriving from a prefixed base _naik_).  


Both the [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) words, as well as [Bimanese](LanguageTable#cldf:241) _neʔe_ ‘climb’ appear to be [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loans, and so do not constitute independent evidence for the disyllable.

[Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _pone_ for the true cognate).

This interpretation appears to be supported by the probably independent development of the metaphorical sense ‘die; death’ in [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), and [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401).

The sporadic loss of the medial vowel everywhere outside Taiwan can be taken as one small piece of evidence for the [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:MP) subgroup.  Irregular reflexes are so common throughout Sulawesi that they can be taken to support a variant &ast;_pondan_ (with borrowing into some languages).  Similarly, reflexes with first-syllable shwa are pervasive in the Lesser Sundas, and suggest a [PCMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCMP) variant &ast;_pendan_.  Although the _P. odoratissimus_ and _P. tectorius_ are the species most commonly noted in dictionary glosses, the term &ast;_paŋudaN_ evidently referred to all _Pandanaceae_.  Varieties of this economically important plant were widely used in the plaiting of mats and baskets.  As noted by [Mills (1975:793)](Source#cldf:mills1975), the frequent lexical equation between the native pandanus and the introduced (South American) pineapple may be due to similarities in the thorny leaves (cf. also [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414) _pedaŋ_ ‘cactus’).

Although reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_paqit_ are most commonly glossed ‘bitter’, various glosses suggest that the meaning of this term did not correspond precisely to any English word, as seen in the recurrent references to the taste of fermented drinks ([Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680), [Ifugaw (Batad)](LanguageTable#cldf:18225), [Ibaloy](LanguageTable#cldf:19182), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947)), to the acrid sensation of smoke entering the nostrils ([Ifugaw (Batad)](LanguageTable#cldf:18225)), and various references to the taste of salt or saltwater ([Ifugaw (Batad)](LanguageTable#cldf:18225), [Ibaloy](LanguageTable#cldf:19182), [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175), [Yakan](LanguageTable#cldf:1129), [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678)).

Given the semantic agreement of [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) _pæʔis_ ‘hot (taste)’ with [Itawis](LanguageTable#cldf:648) _pet_ ‘hotness, pungency, spiciness’ a similar meaning appears to be supported for [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN), but the various phonologically irregular forms in Formosan languages suggest that ‘bitterness’ should not be excluded from the gloss.",PAN,Canonical

First, if [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _perahu_ is a borrowing of _padao_ or _parao_ there is no explanation for its medial _-h-_, nor for the corresponding segment in the [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) and [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) cognates.  Rather, these glottal fricatives agree in pointing to &ast;_q_.  Second, apparent cognates of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _perahu_ are found not only in island Southeast Asia, but also in western Melanesia, a situation that is virtually unknown for established loan distributions.  Finally, because it is also necessary to reconstruct &ast;_padaw_ ‘kind of sailboat’ (q.v.), many Philippine forms are difficult to classify.  [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _paráw_ ‘large passenger and cargo sailboat’ must reflect &ast;_padaw_, and [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _paráw_ (if not a Tagalog loan) must reflect &ast;_paraqu_, but similar forms in other languages, as [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _paráw_ ‘boat’ or [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _parao_ ‘dhow’ are ambiguous for &ast;_paraqu_ or &ast;_padaw_.

This fish was valued for its rough skin, which was used like sandpaper.  

[PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_paRih_ evidently described all skates and rays, and also referred to a constellation which was conceived as resembling a skate or ray.  Three [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) languages which are either closely related or geographically contiguous agree in indicating Scorpio as the constellation in question, while [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _bintaŋ pari_, [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330) _te whai a titipa_ both refer to the Southern Cross or to some feature that is visually near it. The reference to a string figure used in Cat's-cradle in Fiji and parts of Polynesia may derive historically from the constellation.  


Finally, reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_paRih manuk_ vividly illustrate the value of loanwords in reconstruction.  In a number of languages the larger manta or eagle rays are lexically identified with eagles or bats: [Loniu](LanguageTable#cldf:321) _menuay_, [Ahus](LanguageTable#cldf:466) _menwa_, [Pak](LanguageTable#cldf:371), [Leipon](LanguageTable#cldf:730) _menwey_ ‘sea eagle; spotted eagle ray’, [Wuvulu](LanguageTable#cldf:445), [Aua](LanguageTable#cldf:234) _manua_ ‘sea eagle’, [Gapapaiwa](LanguageTable#cldf:609) _manu-manua_ ‘small (=large?) sting ray’, [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _fanihen tasi_ (lit. ‘bat of the sea’) ‘manta ray, sting ray, leopard ray’.  Reflexes such as [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307) _fali-manu_, [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _fai-manu_ thus apparently derive from [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_paRi manuk_ ‘manta ray, spotted eagle ray’ (lit. ‘bird ray’).  This inference is confirmed by a single known non-[Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) reflex, which is clearly a loan: [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _pali-manók_.  Given the larger pattern of known borrowing in [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), one would naturally suspect [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) as the source of this term, but _pari manok_ apparently does not occur in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326). Despite the difficulty of identifying a source, however, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _palimanók_ must derive from a [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) language and the inference to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_paRih manuk_ is inescapable.",PAN,Canonical

However, modern dictionaries do not give [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _piak_, the [Hiligaynon](LanguageTable#cldf:623) and [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226) forms cited here conflict with &ast;_piqak_, and the [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) form is irregular in showing _p-_ rather than _f-_.  [Richards (1981)](Source#cldf:richards1981) cites [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) _piak_, and [Wilkinson (1959:901)](Source#cldf:wilkinson1959) cites [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _pihak_ as a borrowing of Arabic _fihak_ ‘side’, but this is surely wrong, given its presence both in [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660), which preceded sustained Arabic influence, and in languages of the central Philippine which are unlikely to have borrowed it.  Nonetheless [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _pihak_ and [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _pihak-an_ are regular only under a derivation from &ast;_piqak_, leaving several unanswered questions about this comparison.",PWMP,Canonical
30605,"interrogative of quantity: how much?, how many?; adjective of indefinite quantity: some, several, a few",dempwolff193438[];wolff2010[933],*pijax,"Also [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _piaq_ ‘how many?’, [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _pirah_ how many?, _pa-pirah_ ‘how many (in units or number, not in time)’, [Ilongot](LanguageTable#cldf:642) _pigi_ ‘how many?’, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _ilán_ ‘how many?; a few; more than two or three, but not many; several; some’, [Agutaynen](LanguageTable#cldf:19189) _pirapa_ ‘amount; how much?, how many?’, [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _firoy_ ‘how much?, how many?, [Enggano](LanguageTable#cldf:596) _ʔa-píaha_ ‘how much?, how many?’, [Kilivila](LanguageTable#cldf:19026) _vila_ ‘how many?’, [Sa’a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945) _(e)-nite_, [Ulawa](LanguageTable#cldf:1095) _(e)-nita_ ‘how many?, so many; a few’, [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394) _hisi_ ‘how many?  


Used indefinitely (several, I don’t know how many), as well as interrogatively’.  The endings in several of these irregular forms are puzzling.  While [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _–q_ is at odds with all other languages that retain final consonants, [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _–h_, which could reflect [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_S_ or &ast;_h_, presents more subtle problems.  If it reflected &ast;_S_ we would expect a final sibilant in all six of the Formosan witnesses cited here, and this alternative is therefore strongly disfavored.  However, if [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _pirah_ reflects &ast;_pijah_ the only witness that can be cited as a check is [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227).  Nonetheless, since [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) _pina_ contradicts the reconstruction of &ast;_-h_, it seems best to posit [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_pija_, and assume that both [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _piaq_ and [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _pirah_ have added a final consonant through some unknown historically secondary process.  [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _ilán_ for expected &ast;&ast;_pilá_, on the other hand, is doubly irregular in showing loss of &ast;_p-_ and addition of _–n_, but the highly specific semantics make it very likely that this form is also a reflex of &ast;_pija_. 


This form is well-know as an interrogative of quantity, in which sense it has been reconstructed by [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438), and [Wolff (2010:933)](Source#cldf:wolff2010).  However, cognates distributed from [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) to [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330) show clearly that it also functioned as an adjective of indefinite quantity, translatable into English as ‘some, several, a few’.",PAN,Canonical

This term clearly referred to the action of making a choice or selection from a range of alternatives.  However, two more specific senses stand out from the glosses recorded for several languages.  First is the meaning  ‘pick out undesirable inclusions (pebbles, bad grains, etc.) from rice after the pounding and before or during cooking’ ([Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375),[Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282), [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226), [Tausug](LanguageTable#cldf:18831), perhaps [Muna](LanguageTable#cldf:350)).  Second is the meaning ‘what is left over after the best has been picked out’ ([Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)).  Even though the forms that have this meaning generally differ in their overall word shape (taking different affixes), the recurrent association of these two senses of ‘choosing’ with the base &ast;_piliq_ makes it very likely that they were part of the original signification of the term, a signification that can clearly be connected with [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) _&ast;piliq-an_ ‘pick out impurities from husked rice, prior to cooking’.

However, monosyllabic content morphemes are almost unknown in any early Austronesian proto-language, and it is difficult to extract a straightforward comparison from his data. [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) _fō-maɁi_  is phonologically irregular, and morphological data from the language shows that fō cannot be glossed ‘lord’.  The first element of [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _vū-ni-wai_ almost certainly reflects [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_puqun_ ‘base of a tree; cause; source; origin’, and the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) words require morphological analyses that are not independently motivated.

Probably the most controversial feature of this reconstruction is its level, which must be considered questionable for two reasons.  First, [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_beNbeN_ ‘banana’ can be justified on the basis of Formosan evidence.  Second, evidence for the [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) (as opposed to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP)) status of &ast;_punti_ depends critically on the form _puti_ in two dialects of the same language (Ketagalan), which was spoken in extreme northeast Taiwan until the late 19th or early 20th century.  The Spanish occupied this area from 1626-1642, and left some clear loanwords in [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293), spoken just to the south of Ketagalan.  Since the Spanish in Taiwan came from Manila rather than from Spain it is likely that they brought some Filipinos with them, most likely speakers of [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423).  It is thus tempting to consider the [Basai](LanguageTable#cldf:19171) and [Trobiawan](LanguageTable#cldf:19209) words as loans from a Philippine language.  The problem with this hypothesis is that very few Philippine languages have a reflex of &ast;_punti_, and all known cases are found on Palawan or in the Calamian Islands, areas from which Filipinos were not likely to have been taken by the colonial Spanish.  We are left, then, with abundant evidence for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_punti_, but very tenuous evidence for a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) reconstruction of this shape.  If the [Basai](LanguageTable#cldf:19171) and [Trobiawan](LanguageTable#cldf:19209) forms are native rather than borrowed it would appear that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) distinguished two types of bananas.  If, instead, they are loans from the Philippines we must conclude either than some Filipinos from the Palawan region accompanied the 17th century Spanish colonizers of northern Taiwan, or that a reflex of &ast;_punti_ was still found in [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) or neighboring languages some 400 years ago, but has since been replaced by _ságiŋ_.  Since &ast;_sagiŋ_ must be posited for Proto-Central Philippines the latter possibility seems unlikely to find strong support.

[Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569) _púnu_ ‘head, chief, leader’ and [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920) _púno_ ‘head of a social group’ are assumed to be [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) loans.  



[PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_puqun_ is a key term in expressing a variety of both physical and social notions.  Physically it refers most directly to the base of a tree, that is, the part that emerges from the earth.  From this notion of emergence are derived the meanings ‘beginning’, ‘origin’, ‘foundation’, and more abstractly, ‘cause’ and ‘reason’.  Somewhat surprisingly, either alone or with affixation this base is also used in a number of languages to express the idea of ‘capital, starting funds’ in business.  The antiquity of this meaning cannot be great if capital is reckoned solely in terms of a money economy, but if this sense is historically secondary it has arisen in a surprisingly large number of apparently independent cases.  Most importantly for an understanding of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) social organization, reflexes of &ast;_puqun_ in both northern Sumatra ([Gayō](LanguageTable#cldf:610), Northern Batak) and in a number of societies of the Lesser Sundas ([Fox 1980:14](Source#cldf:fox1980)) refer to the mother’s brother as the source or beginning of life for his sister’s son, or more properly for the wife-taking descent group to which he belongs, and whose material and spiritual interests he supports through following the prescribed marriage rule of matrilateral cousin marriage.



In addition, affixed or compound reflexes of &ast;_puqun_ figure in expressing several [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) meanings that might otherwise go unnoticed in broad comparative work.  These include ‘horizon’ (lit. ‘beginning or foundation of the sky’, apparently applied most commonly to horizons on the sea), and ‘stranger, foreigner’ (the latter probably originally ‘person from the horizon’).



Although present evidence allows us to assign &ast;_puqun_ only to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP), an unrelated base with much the same semantic range is seen in [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _qapulu_ ‘trunk, stem; place of origin (figurative); capital (money); founder, earliest ancestor.’  Similarly, although reflexes of &ast;_puqun_ apparently were lost in [Proto-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19084), the concept was retained and associated with Proto-Eastern Polynesian &ast;_tumu_, with much the same semantic range, as seen [Rarotongan](LanguageTable#cldf:388) _tumu_ ‘foundation; root; cause; origin, source, that which introduces; the reason or cause of anything; the trunk or main part of anything from which something springs or is made, created, or fashioned;  _tumu rakau_ ‘trunk of a tree’,  _tumu enua_ ‘the original land; the head or chief of the land, the leaders or people of note of the land, the nobility or aristocracy;  _tumu karakia_ ‘the chief priest of the ancient house of learning who taught all that pertained to the office of the priests, and tribal lore, etc.; to lead off in chanting or reciting;  _tumu mauŋa_ ‘foundation or base of a mountain’;  _tumu raŋi_ ‘clouds’, [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330) _tumu_ ‘foundation’, [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620) _kumu_ ‘bottom, base, foundation, basis, main stalk of a tree, trunk, handle, root (in arithmetic); basic, hereditary; teacher, manual, primer, model, pattern; beginning, source, origin; reason, cause;  _kumu pali_ ‘base, foot of a cliff’;  _aliʔi kumu_ ‘hereditary chief’.",PMP,Canonical

In addition to its basic sense of ‘navel; mid-point or center of a place’ varying expressions that cannot yet be reconstructed with [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_pusej_ evidently also functioned to indicate: 1. the center of the earth ([Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415), [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418), [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357)), 2. the center or deepest part of the sea ([Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Waray-Waray](LanguageTable#cldf:19275), [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236)), 3. the apex of a casting net ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Mentawai](LanguageTable#cldf:335), [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660), [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414)), 4. consanguineal kin ([Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361), [Tontemboan](LanguageTable#cldf:19052), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357)), and 5. a weaving pattern in basketry or with rattan (see &ast;p<in>usej).

It referred to ashes, and prototypically to the ashes in the fireplace (hence its recurrent replacement of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_dapuR_ in the meaning ‘hearth’).  [Dyen (1953:29)](Source#cldf:dyen1953) erred doubly in positing &ast;_abuh_, the erroneous initial following from his acceptance of Dempwolff's use of [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _efu_ ‘ash’ (actually a reflex of &ast;_dapuR_), and the erroneous final from his overconfidence in the evidentiary value of thematic -/_h_/ in the Tagalic languages. 


 Apart from the meanings given here it is likely that some form of &ast;_qabu_ was used to designate a type of plumage for domestic fowls in [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) (cf.

Finally, both the reduplication of &ast;_qabu_ in various daughter languages, and forms assigned to &ast;_paR-qabu-an_ here may be products of convergence.

Although reflexes of &ast;_qabu_ ‘ash’ and &ast;_qabuk_ ‘dust’ clearly are distinct in languages which preserve final consonants, the inclusion of [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) reflexes under &ast;_qabuk_ rather than &ast;_qabu_ is based entirely on semantic fit.  Whereas &ast;_qabu_ evidently referred to ashes, and prototypically to the ashen residue in the hearth, &ast;_qabuk_ evidently designated a range of fine particulate matter produced without combustion (despite occasional semantic cross-over, as in the [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) and [Banggai](LanguageTable#cldf:238) reflexes).

Both this observation and the glosses in languages such as [Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) and [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) make it more likely that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_qaCipa_ and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_qantipa_ referred to the ocean-dwelling hawksbill turtle, which is prized for its widely-traded shell, than to the economically unimportant land tortoise.

We might, therefore, posit three variants: &ast;_qalesem_, &ast;_qaRsem_ and &ast;_qasem_.  Apart from its disturbing proliferation of variants there is a fundamental phonological problem with this interpretation: &ast;_qalesem_ and &ast;_qaRsem_ clearly are distinct, but the evidence for &ast;_qasem_ is generally compatible with &ast;_qalesem_.  On the assumption that the [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) and [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) forms show cluster reduction (with [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) optionally reducing the cluster or breaking it up by metathesis), no Philippine language supports &ast;_qasem_.  Moreover, as noted in [Blust (1982)](Source#cldf:blust1982) there is persuasive evidence that [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) syncopated vowels in the environment VC-CV, with reduction of a resulting cluster of two obstruents. 


Cognates of the material cited in [Blust (1982)](Source#cldf:blust1982) suggest that much the same type of change took place in many of the languages of western Indonesia.  Evidence for &ast;_qalesem_ is not confined to the languages of the _Philippines_, but includes two types of Bornean reflexes: 1) [Lun Dayeh](LanguageTable#cldf:19418) _me-lam_ ‘sour’ and [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _laam_ ‘sour’ preserve a reflex of &ast;_l_, with loss of the first syllable (&ast;_qalesem_ > &ast;_elesem_ > &ast;_lesem_ > &ast;_lehem_ > &ast;_lahem_ > &ast;_laem_ > /laam/), 2) forms such as [Bisaya (Limbang)](LanguageTable#cldf:542) _m-usom_, [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294) _sem_ ‘sour’ contain a penultimate reflex of shwa, not &ast;_a_.  Since all of the North Sarawak and Sabahan languages for which information is available have neutralized the opposition of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_a_ and &ast;_e_ in prepenultimate syllables ([Blust 1974](Source#cldf:blust1974)) these forms are most simply explained as having undergone the first of the changes just cited (&ast;_qalesem_ > &ast;_elesem_), followed by syncopation of medial &ast;_e_, cluster reduction and loss of initial shwa (&ast;_elesem_ > &ast;_elsem_ > &ast;_esem_ > _sem_).  The reconstruction of &ast;_qalesem qalesem_ (rather than &ast;_qasem qasem_) ‘small sour plant with clover-like leaves’ follows from this wider comparative picture.  Finally, since most [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages have syncopated &ast;_e_ in the environment VC-CV, there is little direct evidence for the medial vowel in &ast;_qalesem_.  Yet to reconstruct [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) &ast;_qalsem_ would violate a well-established canonical shape which allows medial consonant clusters to consist only of homorganically prenasalized obstruents (including &ast;_-ŋs-_), of preconsonantal &ast;_R_, or of the abutting consonants in reduplicated monosyllables.

In a number of reflexes the notions of channel and flowing water which evidently formed an inseparable part of the original gloss have been dissociated, leaving this form free to refer to one or the other idea independently ([Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299), [Kenyah](LanguageTable#cldf:300), [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), with reference to flowing water, [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), with reference to animal tracks through the jungle).",PAN,Canonical

The problem that Dempwolff faced in dealing with this comparison was created by 1. a limited choice of languages from which to select cognates, and 2. the extreme variability of seemingly related forms meaning ‘shadow; reflection’, and often by extension ‘soul, spirit of a living being’ (for the identification of the soul with the shadow or reflection as a culture universal cf.

In languages of the _northern Philippines_  such foreshortening may have been favored by oxytonality in a polysyllable which came to be vowel-initial, but no rule can be stated.  The referent of &ast;_qaNuaŋ_ is a matter of some interest.  While this morpheme clearly referred to a large ruminant mammal, this leaves open several possibilities, including: 1. the larger variety of deer (_Cervus equinus_, or _Cervus unicolor_), which were widely hunted for their pelts in Taiwan at the time of European contact, 2. the carabao, or water buffalo, and 3. some other form of bovid.  


The first of these choices is in some ways the least problematic, although 1) it cannot be justified by reflexes in both [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) and [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages, and 2) [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) &ast;_u(R)sa(h)_ must have meant ‘deer, _Cervus_ spp.’, leaving [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) &ast;_qanuaŋ_ with what presumably was some other meaning.  If [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_qaNuaŋ_ and [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) &ast;_qanuaŋ_ had the same referent, then (and there is no reason to believe otherwise), it apparently was not ‘Cervus spp.’.  It is noteworthy that reflexes of &ast;_qaNuaŋ_ refer to unique species of wild buffalo or antelope both in Mindoro (_Bubalus mindorensis_), and in Sulawesi (_Anoa depressicornis_).  Neither referent can be original, however, since the species in question are geographically limited, and neither Mindoro nor Sulawesi is a likely Austronesian homeland.  This leaves the carabao as a plausible referent of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_qaNuaŋ_, with subsequent transfer of the term to various wild varieties of buffalo or buffalo-like animals.  Since terms related to [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _kerbau_, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _kalabáw_ ‘carabao’ are widespread in mainland Southeast Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines, and appear to be loanwords both in Austronesian and in Austroasiatic languages ([Headley 1976:467](Source#cldf:headleyand1976)), it seems likely that the water buffalo was introduced into western Indonesia after the arrival of Austronesian speakers from the north.  The [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) word _kerbau_ then spread with the animal as far north as the central Philippines, but not further north ([McFarland 1977:429](Source#cldf:mcfarland1977)). 


What remains puzzling in all of this is the implication that the carabao was known to speakers of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) (as &ast;_qaNuaŋ_), and that the animal was preserved in Taiwan and the northern Philippines, but lost in areas further to the south. Where the carabao was lost the old name was reapplied to various wild bovids. [Bellwood (1997 [1985]:219-22)](bib-Bellwood) notes that the Lower Yangtze cultures exemplified by, for example, the 7,000-year-old site of Hemudu in the northeastern portion of modern Zhejiang province, show several archaeological traits which make them prime candidates for a pre-[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) phase of the later Austronesian cultural expansion.  Both the domestic pig and water buffalo were present in Lower Yangtze sites by 5,000 B.C., and it is possible that the water buffalo was transported to Taiwan (although no archaeological confirmation for either pig or water buffalo is yet available for the earliest agricultural levels in Taiwan).  If so, it would make the apparent loss of the water buffalo at a later date further to the south even more puzzling.",PAN,Canonical

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_qapejux_ and its reflexes in other early proto-languages apparently referred both to the gall bladder and to its contents, although these are distinguished by modifiers in some attested languages (e.g. [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) _aiʔ empedu_ ‘bile, gall’ = ‘liquid of the gall bladder’; [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _pundi-pundi (h)empedu_ ‘gall bladder’ = ‘sac of the gall’).  


As is evident from several glosses cited here, the gall of various (mostly domesticated?) animals was widely used in augury, although specific details cannot be reconstructed.  Most notably, a morphologically complex expression which juxtaposed a morpheme or sequence of morphemes meaning ‘without’ or ‘not having’ with the word for ‘gall’ was used in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) to describe a person who lacked good judgement or a clear understanding of cultural expectations (cf. reflexes in [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Tontemboan](LanguageTable#cldf:19052), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), and [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816)).  Unlike the case in European languages such as English, German, or French, where human gall typically is associated with emotions that are negative or out of control (anger, bitterness), reflexes of &ast;_qapejux_ in this expression (and in [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _fedew_) are associated with positive character traits and/or social values.  


At the same time the physical bitterness of gall has worked its way into the meanings of some reflexes, or into various expressions using a reflex of &ast;_qapejux_ which are cited in the sources consulted here (reflexes in [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252), [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331), [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), [Hawu](LanguageTable#cldf:405) and [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395), and such expressions as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _pahit daripada hempedu_ ‘more bitter than gall’.",PAN,Canonical

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_qapuR_ and its descendant forms are one of the key elements in the linguistic evidence for the betel culture which accompanied Austronesian speakers as they spread from island Southeast Asia into the western Pacific.  Betel-chewing spread as far as the Southeastern Solomons, but either never reached Vanuatu and points further south and east, or was replaced in those areas by the later, innovative consumption of kava (_Piper methisticum_), which evidently had its origin in Vanuatu ([Crowley 1990](Source#cldf:crowley1990)).  


Scattered references in a number of the sources clearly indicate that lime was made by the burning of mollusc shells or coral limestone, and in the earlier phases of Austronesian expansion was carried on the person in a small gourd container (later replaced in island Southeast Asia by the brass betel box).  Lime may also have been used as a whitewash (oblique references in [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) and [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307)), and by at least [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCEMP) times, if not earlier, lime powder evidently was blown as a ritual gesture of some type (references in [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) and ['Āre'āre](LanguageTable#cldf:18004)). 


The comparisons of lime to sago flesh in two widely separated languages ([Kenyah](LanguageTable#cldf:300) and [Fordata](LanguageTable#cldf:18184)) are interesting, but difficult to interpret without more context.  [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _fag-aful-an_ (for anticipated &ast;&ast;_ferafuran_, from &ast;_paR-qapuR-an_) is assumed to be a loan from a still unidentified source, but problems remain even with this interpretation (&ast;_R_ > /g/ in the prefix, but &ast;_R_ > /l/ in the stem).  It is possible that the reconstruction of &ast;_paR-qapuR-an_, a form that appears to have been entirely synonymous with &ast;_paŋ-qapuR-an_, is simply misguided.  Finally, [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _Hu naʔye afok i maiʔes_ ‘I put lime on the corn’ and [Wetan](LanguageTable#cldf:1118) _air-i_ ‘lime, put lime on’ appear to reflect two stages in the history of the suffix &ast;_-i_ ‘local transitive’, the first while it still remains a generic preposition marking location in space or time, and the second after it has become a transitive verb suffix with locative overtones.",PAN,Canonical

Many words which may reflect &ast;_qaqay_ are ambiguous for &ast;_qaqay_ or &ast;_waqay_.  The loss of &ast;_q_ and contraction of the resulting sequence of like vowels in this form led to a canonically atypical monosyllabic content word /_ay_/ in some languages.  In response to canonical pressure this sequence was resyllabified as /_ai_/, or even /_ayi_/.  Where the final diphthong had been monophthongized to -/_e_/ prior to loss of &ast;_q_ such pressures were inapplicable. 


 It is noteworthy that although a single term appears to have been used for both ‘foot’ and ‘leg’ in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN), [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) and [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP), such parts of the leg as the shin (&ast;_lulud_), calf (&ast;_bitiqis_) and thigh (&ast;_paqa_) were terminologically distinguished by at least [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) times, and reflexes of the latter two have often replaced reflexes of &ast;_qaqay_ in the meaning ‘foot, leg’.",PAN,Canonical

Since the known reflexes of (a) are both more common and more widely attested than those of (b) (being found in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) _and_ [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) languages), &ast;_qani-Ruan_ is perhaps the preferred shape of such an invariant prototype.

An invariant prototype &ast;_qari-ñuan_ not only exacerbates this problem, but cannot account for the stem-initial _g_ of various Philippine reflexes. This difficulty might be alleviated by positing &ast;_qaRi-ñuan_, but among other obstacles to such an interpretation independent evidence for a prefix &ast;_qaRi-_ is unknown.  On balance, then, the reconstruction of doublets with complementary affixation, although not without its problems, appears preferable to an invariant prototype.

Two species of scaly anteater or pangolin are found in island Southeast Asia: 1. the _Manis pentadactyla_, and 2. the _Manis javanica_ Desmarest.  The former is confined to Taiwan, while the latter has a fairly wide distribution including the island of Palawan and the adjacent Kalamian and Cuyo Islands in the Philippines, the Greater Sunda Islands of Indonesia, including Borneo, Sumatra and Java, and portions of the Southeast Asian mainland ([Taylor 1934](Source#cldf:taylor1934)). 


 Since the islands where the more southerly species is found all rest on the submerged Sunda Shelf, and since this is not true of any other Philippine islands, it is likely that the _Manis javanica_ acquired its attested distribution at a time when the Greater Sunda Islands of Indonesia and the Palawan group of the Philippines were joined with the Asian mainland.  [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_qaRem_ presumably referred to the _Manis pentadactyla_, but since its reflexes refer to both species we are faced with a puzzle: how did the name for ‘pangolin’ survive when Austronesian speakers moved south into parts of the Philippines where pangolins were not found?

[Grace (1972)](Source#cldf:grace1972) suggests that [Canala](LanguageTable#cldf:568) (New Caledonia) _ka_ ‘enemy, one to be killed and eaten’ may be connected, but this would be the only known reflex of &ast;_qaRta_ in an [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) language, and in view of the phonemic brevity of the form I do not see how convergence can safely be excluded as an explanation of the observed similarity.  [Reid (1989:51)](Source#cldf:reid1989), [Reid (n.d.)](bib-Reid) posits &ast;_qaRtaq_, a form which is supported by several Central Philippine  witnesses as noted above, but which is in conflict with the absence of a final consonant in at least [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), Sama-Bajaw, [Proto-Minahasan](LanguageTable#cldf:19080), [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245), [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372), and [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391).  Since the latter languages form a rather diverse collection, it is simpler to hypothesize an irregular change in one Central Philippine  language which diffused to surrounding speech communities rather than an irregular loss of &ast;_-q_ on as many as six historically independent occasions. 


 Finally, the arguments presented in [Blust (1972)](Source#cldf:blust1972) for assigning a meaning ‘outsiders, alien people’ to this form now appear stronger than ever.  Based on ‘occurrences of unique alleles’ [Bellwood (1997 [1985])](bib-Bellwood) notes that the Negritos of Luzon and Mindanao probably have been separated for over 10,000 years.  The distribution of phenotypically similar Negrito populations in the interior of the Malay Peninsula and in the Andaman Islands suggests that a Negrito population was widespread in island Southeast Asia when phenotypically southern Mongoloid Austronesian-speaking populations began to arrive in the region.  [Blust (1981)](Source#cldf:blust1981) argues for cultural contact and borrowing of animistic beliefs between indigenous Negrito and incoming Austronesian -speaking groups by about 3,000 B.C.  


Most recently [Reid (1987)](Source#cldf:reid1987) has argued persuasively that incoming agricultural Austronesians must have encountered an established Negrito hunter-gatherer population in the Philippines which over the course of time assimilated linguistically to the new arrivals.  Under such conditions it is not difficult to see how &ast;_qaRta_ would have been applied by Austronesian speakers to the Negrito population of the Philippines, and ultimately adopted as a self-designation by some of these same groups.  In other areas the term came to be applied to outsiders taken in war whose social position was that of ‘slave’ (someone with no claims to filiation with lineages of the dominant group).  More puzzling are the semantic innovations which caused &ast;_qaRta_ to replace [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_tau_ in the meaning ‘person, human being’.",PMP,Canonical

[PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_qaRus_ clearly meant ‘current’ (either of rivers or the sea), but also appears to have functioned verbally in the meaning ‘to flow’.

Given this comparison it would appear more likely that Spanish _atún_ is a loan from [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) or some other Philippine language.""  It now appears that [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _atún_ is, indeed, a Spanish loan.  For Spanish _atún_ [Serrano (1872)](Source#cldf:serrano1872) gives [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _bangús na malaquing dinaing_, and [Laktaw (1914)](Source#cldf:laktaw1914) gives [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _bangús na malakí_, the first gloss meaning ‘big dried/salted milkfish’ and the latter simply ‘big milkfish’.  Neither author list _atún_ as a [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) word.  Given the lack of supporting evidence from any other non-[Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)  language there appears to be no choice except to limit the reconstruction of &ast;_qatun_ to [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC).  


We are then confronted with the question of where Spanish got the word.  [Corominas and Pascual (1980)](bib-Corominas) note that Spanish _atún_, Portuguese _atum_ ‘albacore, tuna’ generally is thought to derive from Arabic _tûn_.  However, they do not suggest even an approximate date for its introduction, and point out that: 1. under this hypothesis the initial vowel is unexplained, and 2. the borrowing of such a term is problematic, given the traditionally great importance of albacore fishing on the Andalusian coast of the Atlantic.  They note, moreover, that the Arabic term itself is thought to originate ultimately from Latin _thŭnnus_ ‘tunny fish’, and indicate that a straightforward Latin reflex appears in Portuguese _toninha/toninho_ ‘young of the albacore (also used of the albacore in general)’.  


It is obvious from the discussion in Corominas and Pascual that the traditional etymology of Spanish _atún_ is unsatisfactory in more than one respect, and it is equally obvious that the Spanish term could not be borrowed from [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423).This leaves only one, somewhat surprising hypothesis to consider: that the Spanish borrowed the term from an [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)> language which preserved final consonants.  This would limit the possible sources to the Solomon Islands and portions of the Bismarck Archipelago.  The Mendaña expedition of 1567-68 discovered the main chain of the Solomon islands, and a Spanish settlement was established on Nendö Island in the Santa Cruz group in 1595 ([Allen 1976](Source#cldf:allen1976)).  It is perhaps during these early years of Pacific exploration that the term became established in Spanish, since bonito trawling was an activity of great practical and even ritual importance in various parts of this region.  


In the Southeast Solomons the cultural expression of interest in the bonito reaches an almost cult-like intensity ([Ivens 1972 [1927]:130ff](bib-Ivens)).  Phonological considerations rule out the _Southeast Solomons_  as a source of the term, but it could perhaps have been acquired from an OC language further to the west, or even conceivably from [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) if a cognate of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_qatun_ was once found in that language but was subsequently lost (cf.

Since this cannot be the case in the eastern Pacific, and is unlikely in those [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) forms which show close semantic agreement with their [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) cognates (meanings such as ‘in a row’) the reconstruction of [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCEMP) &ast;_qatur_ appears to be unavoidable.  The only remaining questions, then, are: 1. are [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) forms such as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _(h)atur_ cognate with reflexes of [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCEMP) &ast;_qatur_?, and 2. which non-[OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) forms are directly inherited, and which are [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loanwords?  With regard to the first question I follow [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) in affirming a connection. However, Dempwolff clearly erred in including e.g. [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _hátol_ ‘sentence pronounced by a judge in court; counsel; medical prescription for an ailment’ as a directly inherited cognate of the other forms in his comparison, since [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) /_h_/- cannot be united under a single formula with e.g. [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) /_ʔ_/-.

One of the basic [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:MP) root crops, the yam was carried by Austronesian speakers from island Southeast Asia into the Pacific as far east as Hawaii. No reflexes of &ast;_qubi_ have yet been found in Taiwan, and there is consequently no linguistic evidence that the plant was domesticated by Austronesian speakers prior to [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:MP) times.  


The thematic consonant in [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _ubih-an_ ‘yam patch’ indicates an etymon &ast;_qubih_, but this is contradicted by [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _ovi_ ‘yam’.  Finally, reflexes of &ast;_qubi_ have been extended to several tuberous plants of South American origin which were introduced into Southeast Asia by the Portuguese and Spanish.

The collocation &ast;_qubi kahiw_ can be reconstructed with the meaning ‘cassava’, although there is no evidence that cassava was known in [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) times.  There appear to be three possible explanations for this contradiction: 1. reflexes of &ast;_qubi kahiw_ are borrowings from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), 2. a collocation &ast;_qubi kahiw_ was found in [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP), but had some other meaning (e.g. ‘type of yam’) which was systematically replaced by the meaning ‘cassava’ once the later was introduced, and 3. the collocation itself is a product of convergent innovation after the introduction of cassava, much like the widespread Algonkian cognates meaning ‘gun’ and ‘whiskey’ ([Bloomfield 1946](Source#cldf:bloomfield1946)).",PMP,Canonical

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) posited &ast;_qutan_ ‘Wald’ ( = ‘woods, forest’).  However, reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_halas_ almost invariably mean ‘forest’, while reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_qutan_ cover a wide range of referents, including at least ‘vegetable’ ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) + [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP)), ‘weed’ ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) + [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)), ‘forest’ ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) + [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) + [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC)), ‘wild’ ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) + [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP)) and bean ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) + [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP)).  This striking difference in ""semantic profile"" ([Blust 1987](Source#cldf:blust1987)) clearly favors the reconstruction of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_alas_ with the meaning ‘forest’, but it does not mechanically provide us with a gloss for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_qutan_.  To gloss the latter we must consider both the range of its semantic reflexes and its relationship to other [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) terms, such as &ast;_alas_. 



At first sight there is little apparent connection between such meanings as ‘vegetable’ and ‘forest’, and we might therefore treat the reflexes of &ast;_qutan_ which cluster about each of these meanings as belonging to different cognate sets.  Apart from the problems of synonymy already mentioned in connection with &ast;_alas_, what makes it difficult to segregate these semantic clusters under two homophonous [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) reconstructions, &ast;_qutan_₁ and &ast;_qutan_₂, is the presence of forms which provide a clear semantic bridge between them. First, the meanings ‘vegetable’ and ‘wild’ can be reconciled through a hypothesis that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_qutan_ referred to wild vegetables, a meaning that is actually reflected in [Alune](LanguageTable#cldf:471) _utane_.  Second, the semantic reflex ‘weed’ (and the similar meaning ‘grass’ in [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) and [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372)) can be explained by modifying our hypothesis to state that &ast;_qutan_ referred to small, wild herbaceous plants whether they were edible/useful or not.  Third, the meaning ‘bean’ can be included as an implicit component of our reconstructed gloss by hypothesizing that leguminous plants constituted an important part of the total inventory of small, wild herbaceous plants known to speakers of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP). Finally, the meaning ‘forest’ can be added under the assumption that &ast;_qutan_ referred both to a type of vegetation and to the type of land on which it grew. 



 The difficulty of glossing [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_quCaN_ stems from the paucity of known [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) reflexes.  For [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_qutan_ this problem does not exist; rather, it is difficult to arrive at an adequate gloss because there appears to be no single convenient English lexical category which corresponds to the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) concept.  If we gloss &ast;_qutan_ as ‘small, wild herbaceous plants; scrub-land, bush’ we will perhaps come close to the sense of the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) term.  A meaning very similar to the first half of this gloss is reflected in [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) _uta_ ‘underbrush, scrub, low-growing plants’ and [Lakalai](LanguageTable#cldf:877) _la-huta-huta_ ‘general term for small plants and leaves’.  Apart from its additional reference to type of land the meaning of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_qutan_ is essentially identical to what [Brown (1984:13)](Source#cldf:brown1984) has called _grerb_: ""Small plant (relative to the plant inventory of a particular environment) whose parts are chiefly herbaceous (green, leafy, nonwoody)."" 



The basic correctness of this interpretation is strikingly confirmed by a secondary meaning of [Lakalai](LanguageTable#cldf:877) _la-huta-huta_, ‘trash’, since [Brown (1984:62)](Source#cldf:brown1984) has argued that ""terms for _grerb_ in both Polynesian and Mayan languages have developed from words for rubbish, garbage, trash, litter, rotten stuff, and the like.  In most cases such words were first extended to weeds, i.e., useless and bothersome small herbaceous plants, and then through expansion of reference to small herbaceous plants in general.""  However, in the present case there can be no doubt that the semantic development in [Lakalai](LanguageTable#cldf:877) _la-huta-huta_ has been from ‘_grerb_’ to ‘trash’ rather than the reverse.  Finally, it is notable that in [Southeast Ambrym](LanguageTable#cldf:996) the reflex of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_qutan_ acquired a sense very similar to that associated with reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_banua_ ‘inhabited territory’ in other [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages, and like some of these came to mean ‘weather’, thus providing another example of what I have elsewhere called a ‘semantic cycle’ in historical change ([Blust 1989b](Source#cldf:blust1989)).",PAN,Canonical

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_qudip_ ‘to live’, and although this semantic reconstruction is justified, it appears incomplete in a number of respects due to differences in the ""conceptual focus"" ([Blust 1991a](Source#cldf:blust1991)) of the German/English and  Austronesian terms.  Whereas English ‘living, alive’ denotes merely the presence of life processes, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_qudip_ evidently denoted a dominance of vitality as manifested in growth, flourishing, and being healthy, fresh (of plants), or green (of plants, wood). 


 Reflexes in [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:MP) languages show recurrent references to vegetation and to growth, a component of the meaning which is reinforced by the observation that &ast;_qudip_ has been replaced in a number of the languages of Sulawesi by reflexes of &ast;_tumbuq_ ‘to grow’.  If anything in English reminds us of this conceptual focus it is perhaps the depiction of the life-force in Dylan Thomas, ‘The force that through the green fuse drives the flower’ (‘Drives my green age ... ‘).  


Extensions of this primary sense are seen in [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) &ast;_qudip_ 'mend, repair' ([Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) and [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331)), recurrent references to newness ([Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) and ['Āre'āre](LanguageTable#cldf:18004)), the new moon ([Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395), [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330), [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620)), and birth ([Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060), [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945)) and perhaps the soul, where the vital principle is seen as essentially supernatural ([Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), [Lonwolwol](LanguageTable#cldf:320), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390), [Anuta](LanguageTable#cldf:229), [Rarotongan](LanguageTable#cldf:388), [Nukuoro](LanguageTable#cldf:363)), and so applied to body parts that have well-known associations with the exit and entry of the soul ([Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390): skull, fontanel, [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620): fontanel).  [Mota](LanguageTable#cldf:344) _maur_! ‘cry to a child that sneezes’ and [Tuvaluan](LanguageTable#cldf:19417) _ma-uli_ ‘a sneeze; to sneeze’ undoubtedly derive from formulaic expressions wishing health or protection from the loss of the soul [Tylor (1958 [1871]:1:97ff)](bib-Tylor).  

Although this is substantially similar to traditional European beliefs, the different emphasis of the Austronesian term in comparison with the English term is seen again in the recurrent references to healing, curing, reviving and recovering (where the life-force is reasserting not merely its presence, but its dominance).  A metaphorical extension of the notion of healing or riviving is seen in [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _údip_ ‘mend, patch (mats, baskets, etc.)’, [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _orip_ ‘reweave, patch up, repair a mat’ (hence [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) &ast;_qudip_ ‘patch a mat’).  


Finally, there are difficult questions with some features of the morphology of this form.  I assume that the similar infixation in [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _h-um-urip_ and such [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) forms as [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _q-m-uzi-quzip_ is a product of convergence, and that despite the widespread loss of morpheme boundary in [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CEMP) reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_ma-qudip_, [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCEMP) must have had &ast;_ma-qudip_ (not &ast;_maqudip_), since [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945) _haʔa-uri_ appears to be a straightforward reflex of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_paka-qudip_.",PAN,Canonical

Tobacco could not have been introduced prior to Portuguese contact in the 16th century, and the smoking of opium probably was introduced by southern Chinese no earlier than the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 A.D.), at which time a loanword for ‘smoking pipe’ (_hunsuy_, etc.) entered many of the Austronesian languages of Taiwan, the Philippines and western Indonesia.

The irregular vowel change in [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) _hileud_ is assumed to be independent of that in the Polynesian languages, but for the latter it is simplest to assume a single innovation (hence PPn &ast;_ʔilo_).  Since the reduplicated forms of &ast;_qulej_ show little semantic agreement the doubling of this stem may have occurred independently in various languages.  Nonetheless, in view of the inescapably collective character of the referent and the common use of reduplication in Austronesian languages to indicate plurality or intensity, I tentatively reconstruct [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_qulej qulej_ as a collective or intensive form (‘lots of worms’, ‘crawling with worms, extremely wormy’).  


Perhaps the most challenging feature of this comparison is its meaning.  On present evidence all that can safely be reconstructed for [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) is the meaning ‘maggot’.  It is clear that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) retained this meaning, but added the referent ‘caterpillar’.  [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_qulej_ thus meant essentially ‘larva of a flying insect’.  This meaning persisted in [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCEMP) and Proto-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, but [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) evidently innovated &ast;_muno_ in the meaning ‘caterpillar’, thus once again restricting the referent of the present form to ‘maggot’.  Most problematic is the evidence from [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386), [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) and [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) _&ast;qulej_ meant not only ‘maggot’, but also ‘insect’.  [Brown (1984)](Source#cldf:brown1984) has argued that generic labels for an insect ( = ‘wug’) lexical category develop late in the history of languages, and it seems likely that the sparse and scattered agreements cited here are convergent.  


Finally, the specific agreement of [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _ulud-úlud_ and [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _olitra_ in referring to tooth decay suggests a [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) belief that dental caries are caused by a burrowing worm in the tooth.",PAN,Canonical

The reconstruction of final &ast;_h_ in this form has resulted from comments received from Laurent Sagart. Although only the meaning ‘head’ can be assigned to [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_quluh_, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_qulu_ clearly had a number of meanings in addition to its primary use as a body-part label.

It is tempting to consider [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _chum_ as a loan from an [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) language for the following reasons: 1. it is the only reflex of &ast;_qumun_ yet reported in any non-[CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CEMP) language, 2. it appears to show an irregular loss of the last consonant.  The difficulty with this hypotheses is that no [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) language which preserves &ast;_q-_ as a glottal stop is available as a likely source for the [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) word.  


Moreover, [McManus and Josephs (1977)](bib-McManus) list no less than six forms under _meŋum_: 1. _meŋúm_ ‘bake (food) in a hole in the ground’, 2. _chumíi_, 3. _chum_, 4. _chilumíi_, 5. _chilúm_, 6. _klum_ ‘hole in the ground for baking’.  The second and fourth of these may be interpreted as reflecting a doublet &ast;_qumul_ (distinct from [Dobuan](LanguageTable#cldf:258) _ʔumura_, [Molima](LanguageTable#cldf:18975) _ʔumula_, which reflect earlier &ast;_qumur_).  Alternatively, we might argue that under certain conditions final nasals normally were lost in [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372); other examples that might be cited are &ast;_qumaŋ_ ‘hermit crab’ > _chum_ ‘kind of snail’ and perhaps  &ast;_ijuŋ_ > _íis_ ‘nose’.  It is simplest, then, to treat [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _chum_ as a native form.  However, in so doing we are forced to conclude that &ast;_qumun_ (and evidently the use of the earth oven) disappeared in all other [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP)-speaking societies.  Given the predominantly [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) character of Palauan culture this presents us with a remarkable apparent coincidence: that a [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) reflex of &ast;_qumun_ was retained only in that [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP)-speaking society which most closely approximates the general [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) culture type.",PMP,Canonical

The semantic extension to ‘turtle shell’ is attested to date only from the Moluccas, southeast Solomons and Polynesia, and is tentatively attributed to [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCEMP). A number of MIC languages reflect &ast;_qunap_ not only with the meaning ‘scale’, but also with the meanings ‘feathers’, ‘hair’ and ‘fur’ (viz. any natural body covering).

Part of this comparison is drawn from [Tsuchida (1976:171)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976).

In a number of the languages of the northern Philippines it is explicitly marked as a loan from [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) or [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), and in a number of the languages of Indonesia it is explicitly marked as a loan from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326). 


These explicit lexicographic statements (which presumably reflect native speaker reactions) are further strengthened by phonological irregularities in such languages as [Kalamian Tagbanwa](LanguageTable#cldf:18285) and [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175), and by the fact that this word refers most commonly to the borrowing of _money_ rather than of objects to be returned either themselves or in kind.  


On the other hand, the word is richly attested in the Philippines and western Indonesia, and a number of apparently non-borrowed affixed forms can be reconstructed for [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP).

In [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) the reflexes of &ast;_qutiN_ ‘penis’ and &ast;_utiŋ_ ‘pin at the base of a blade which fits into the hilt to bind the two together’ have come to be homophonous.

Although a future verbal sense is indicated both by [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) and by [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273), it is likely that &ast;_q-um-uzaN_ functioned both as the verb ‘to rain’ and as the (subjectless) sentential comment ‘it is raining’. As is often the case in derived reduplications with only generic semantic similarity, the evidence for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_quzan quzan_ may be a product of convergence. 


 The most striking of the morphologically complex units built around &ast;_quzan_ undoubtedly is [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_quzan batu_ ‘hail’, as it implies a continuous familiarity with hailstorms throughout the millennia-long migrations of the [Malayo-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:MP)-speaking peoples.  This is surprising, as many of the reflexes are found not in the more northerly languages of Taiwan  and the _Philippines_ , but rather in languages that are spoken very near the Equator, and in some cases close to sea level.  Perhaps the agreement of [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390) _ʔua hatu_ with similar forms in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages is also a product of convergence, since the collocation ‘stone rain’ is semantically transparent, and could easily be invented independently (cp. [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _ʔuha maka_ (lit. ""stone rain"") = ‘hail’, where, however, _maka_ may be a lexical replacement of earlier _fatu_). Finally, although the mutually corroboratory irregularity in the Batak languages and [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) and Modern [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) in reflecting /_d_/ rather than /_j_/ in this form has been noted both by [van der Tuuk (1971)](bib-van) and by [Dyen (1951)](Source#cldf:dyen1951), the evidence for a distinct phoneme &ast;_Z_ is in fact internally contradictory, and is disregarded here.",PAN,Canonical

However, this word is attested in a number of other languages of the Admiralty Islands, including [Likum](LanguageTable#cldf:319) on the southwest coast, [Mondropolon](LanguageTable#cldf:854) on the north-central coast, [Leipon](LanguageTable#cldf:730) on a separate island off the northeast coast, and [Nauna](LanguageTable#cldf:355), located some distance from Manus in the southeastern Admiralties.  The gloss given for the [Nauna](LanguageTable#cldf:355) form, together with cover terms for ‘whale, dolphin’ in [Mokilese](LanguageTable#cldf:342) and [Puluwat](LanguageTable#cldf:385) indicate that &ast;_rato_ probably referred to one of the smaller common whales, perhaps the pilot whale.  



In collecting data from these languages during linguistic fieldwork in 1975 I distinguished whales from dolphins, but did not distinguish types of whales unless this information was spontaneously volunteered.  The most commonly elicited form for ‘whale’ was a reflex of Proto-Eastern Admiralty &ast;_moluam_, but this term designates the largest (and hence psychologically most salient) cetacean, and if a concerted effort had been made to elicit terms for different types of whales I have no doubt that reflexes of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_rato_ designating the smaller whale found in the Admiralties would have been much more frequent.",POC,Canonical

The &ast;_Rakit_ probably was made of bamboo, which is highly buoyant, and difficult to sink or become waterlogged.  Although cognates are unknown in Taiwan, it is likely that Austronesian speakers reached Taiwan from the mainland of southern China (Fujian) by means of bamboo rafts, since there is no evidence for the outrigger canoe prior to [Proto-Malayo-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19081).  Rafts continued to be useful for purposes of short water crossings, long after outrigger canoes had become the primary means of long-distance oversea exploration.  Their function probably was primarily to ferry people and goods across large rivers or short water crossings.  For this reason rafts were retained in places like Mindanao or Borneo, where there were many rivers to cross, but lost in places like the Marianas, Micronesia or Polynesia, where open water crossings required more sophisticated watercraft.

As the matter is pursued in greater depth with more languages the history of this word becomes even more perplexing, as nearly all reflexes in both the Philippines and Indonesia appear to be [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loans, yet a few languages have forms that cannot be explained in this way, pointing instead to &ast;_Ribu_. This is clearly true of [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) in the southern Philippines, and of the Berawan languages in Sarawak, both of which reflect [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_R_ as _g_ in this word.  It also appears to be true of the [Kenyah](LanguageTable#cldf:300) dialects (including [Penan](LanguageTable#cldf:18658)), which normally lose &ast;_R_ word-initially.  Many other forms are ambiguous: e.g. is [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _ríbo_ ‘thousand’ native, or is it a [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loanword that has acquired native affixation in the form _sa-ŋa-ríbo_ ‘one thousand’?  All in all it seems best to assume that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) had a word &ast;_Ribu_ ‘thousand’ that was lost or replaced in Proto-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, but preserved in many languages of western Indonesia and the Philippines, only to be replaced in time by [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _ribu_, presumably as a consequence of the dominant role of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) in pan-archipelagic trade over the past two millennia.

The history of irrigated rice in the Austronesian world remains unclear.  While evidence of rice agriculture at the time of the initial Austronesian settlement of Taiwan is abundant in both the long-established linguistic record and in the much more recent, but key archaeological site of Nankuangli East at the Science-based Industrial Park in Tainan, all that either line of evidence unambigously supports is swidden rice.  

The present comparison (based just on [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _manawan_ ‘to harvest’, and [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _cava_ ‘harvest time’), was first proposed by [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438).  However, the [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) and [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) forms are best left out, little additional supporting evidence has been found through subsequent searching, and the [Ida'an Begak](LanguageTable#cldf:18943), Kuamut, Belusu, [Bulungan](LanguageTable#cldf:19467), [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418), [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235), [Salako](LanguageTable#cldf:1002) and possibly [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) terms all seem to be loans from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326). Given this limited evidence, and the absence of a suite of related terms such as is known for swidden rice in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN), the meaning of &ast;_sabaq_ must remain tentative.

Although direct evidence for the base form is lacking to date, it seems clear that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) must have had &ast;_saku_ in addition to &ast;_saku layaR_. &ast;_saku_ may have referred to needlefish, swordfish and other fish with an elongated upper jaw that lack the sail-like dorsal fin of _Istiophorus_ species.  The longer word almost certainly contains [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_layaR_ ([Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434), [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362),  [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) _lā_) ‘sail’.  Some languages, however, have replaced either the second element of &ast;_saku layaR_ or the word for ‘sail’ (or both) with an unrelated root: [Wogeo](LanguageTable#cldf:19063) _sak barema_ (compare _ieba_ ‘sail’), [Mokilese](LanguageTable#cldf:342) _i_, [Puluwat](LanguageTable#cldf:385) _maaŋ_, [Pohnpeian](LanguageTable#cldf:381) _serek_ ‘sail’.  


Other languages have what appears to be a reflex of &ast;_layaR_ in both words, but the phonological development of this morpheme in the fish name exhibits irregularities: compare [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _yars_, [Yapese](LanguageTable#cldf:1134) _laay_, [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _laca_ ‘sail’.  Still others, such as [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362), contain a regular reflex of &ast;_layaR_ in both meanings, but do not appear to relate them synchronically. [Loniu](LanguageTable#cldf:321), [Titan](LanguageTable#cldf:1070), [Nauna](LanguageTable#cldf:355) _colay_ ‘sailfish, swordfish, marlin’ (but [Loniu](LanguageTable#cldf:321) _peley_, [Titan](LanguageTable#cldf:1070) _paley_, [Nauna](LanguageTable#cldf:355) _pale_ ‘sail’) possibly show an irregular contraction of the first morpheme.  Together with [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _ikan selayar_ ‘sailfish; name given to fish with large dorsal fins, esp. the sword-fish, sun-fish, and basking shark’, however, these forms from the Admiralty Islands may point to a doublet &ast;_selayaR_.",PMP,Canonical

This word evidently contained schwa in the environment VC__CV, where it was subject to syncope in many daughter languages.  Vowel syncope left an unstable medial cluster _–ŋl-_, and languages coped with this in various ways.  In the Philippines many languages assimilated the nasal to the place of the liquid, producing _–nl-_ either as the only form ([Hiligaynon](LanguageTable#cldf:623), [Waray-Waray](LanguageTable#cldf:19275), [Masbatenyo](LanguageTable#cldf:19186), [Binukid](LanguageTable#cldf:19012)) or as a variant of _–ŋl-_ ([Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244)).  As a further step, in languages such as [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331), [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819), or [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245), the liquid was replaced by _d_, thus conforming to the high frequency pattern of medial homorganically prenasalized stops.  A similar strategy in languages of northern Sumatra and south Sulawesi preserved the velar nasal and assimilated the liquid to it as a voiced velar stop, as in [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _saŋgal_ or [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) _saŋgaraʔ_.  [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _saŋág_ may show cluster simplification, although it is just as likely that the loss of the liquid in this form is part of the larger pattern in which some instances of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_l_ became _h_ or disappeared.  [Minangkabau](LanguageTable#cldf:337) _salar_ and [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _selar_ show cluster reduction by deletion of the first consonant (except in the [Minangkabau](LanguageTable#cldf:337) variant saŋlar), and forms in CMP languages show cluster reduction by deletion of the second consonant. 


Malay and CMP languages appear to have undergone prepenultimate vowel neutralization to schwa while this word was still trisyllabic: _&ast;saŋelaR_ ([_saŋəlar_]) > _səŋəlaR_ > _səŋlaR_ > _səlaR_ > [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _səlar_ (and presumably [Minangkabau](LanguageTable#cldf:337) _salar_, with regular &ast;_ə_ > _a_); &ast;_saŋelaR_ ([_saŋəlar_]) > _səŋəlaR_ > _səŋlaR_ > _səŋaR_ > _sənaR_ > _sonaR_ > [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) _sena_, [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) _sona_, etc.  The final vowel of [Lamaholot](LanguageTable#cldf:19031) _səŋeʔ_ is evidently irregular, although the precise history of this form is unclear. 


 Finally, the meaning of this form does not seem to correspond exactly to any English term, as it refers to cooking in a frying pan without oil by rapidly stirring the contents to prevent burning, much as in stir-frying with a Chinese wok.",PMP,Canonical

 In the western Pacific the orientation of the west monsoon to the north-south axis appears to be somewhat different.  The languages of the Admiralty Islands (all within 2 degrees s. latitude) and a number of those in southeastern Papua (roughly 10 degrees s. latitude) refer to the west monsoon as a ‘northwest’ wind, whereas the languages of both western and eastern Indonesia at corresponding latitudes refer to it as a ‘west’ wind.

It is likely that ‘to walk backward’ is a secondary development from the meaning ‘to backpaddle’, since retrograde motion in walking has no practical or cultural significance, whereas backpaddling is needed for turning a canoe around when a change of direction is desired.  The meaning ‘to tack’ appears to be an innovation in [Proto-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19084) that was borrowed into [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394), with tacking possibly linked to the notion of retrograde motion, or at least the absence of forward motion in sailing.

Somewhat confusingly, [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_suku_ ‘paw; one quarter (a quarter of the people) = unit of kinship’.  The true meaning emerges from the work of F.A.E. [van Wouden (1935)](bib-van), who was writing his well-known book on the history of social structure in eastern Indonesia at the same time Dempwolff was writing his _Vergleichende Lautlehre_.  Since van Wouden posited an original marriage/alliance system of asymmetric exchange that contained four lineages in an arrangement of ‘circulating connubium’ the &ast;_suku_ would have referred to one of these four lineages, and its otherwise puzzling sense of ‘one fourth’ in languages like [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), which have not used such a system within historical times, becomes intelligible, since the &ast;_suku_ was both a lineage and one quarter of the total social order.


This term is preserved only in a very fragmentary form in a handful of societies in western Indonesia and another handful in eastern Indonesia.  What is noteworthy is that it has been preserved best in societies that have unilineal systems of descent, as among the Batak of northern Sumatra, the Minangkabau of western Sumatra, and a few of the societies of Flores and the Solor archipelago.  The most likely referent for this [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) term was ‘lineage’, that is a social unit that traced descent through a single apical ancestor (male among the Batak and eastern Indonesian groups, female among the Minangkabau).

There is no doubt that this term referred to the west monsoon of island Southeast Asia and portions of western Melanesia, in contradistinction to the east monsoon, &ast;_timuR_ (q.v.).  


Apart from a few anomalous glosses ([Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _balat_, [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _evaǥat_) the references to cardinal directions in the reflexes are consistent with a west wind centered very near the Equator.  In [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) (23 degrees n. latitude) this is described as a ‘south’ wind, throughout most of the Philippines (5-18 degrees n. latitude) it is described as a ‘south’ or ‘southwest’ wind, in most of the languages of Indonesia (5 degrees n. latitude to 10 degrees s. latitude) it is described as a ‘west’ wind, and in Merina, the standard dialect of [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) (23 degrees s. latitude) the meaning is ‘north’ (presumably a secondary semantic development after the Malagasy migration from southeast Borneo).  


In the western Pacific the orientation of the west monsoon to the north-south axis appears to be somewhat different.  The languages of the Admiralty Islands (all within 2 degrees s. latitude) and a number of those in southeastern Papua (roughly 10 degrees s. latitude) refer to the west monsoon as a ‘northwest’ wind, whereas the languages of both western and eastern Indonesia at corresponding latitudes refer to it as a ‘west’ wind.

Nataoran Amis _salili_ appears for expected &ast;&ast;_sarili_; the comparative data for this [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) dialect are not yet sufficient to determine whether the assimilation in this form is regular or sporadic, but the cognation of the form is hardly in question.  In this connection it is worth noting that among the [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) aborigines only the Amis, Kavalan  and Ketagalan (the latter now extinct) built houses elevated on posts ([Ferrell 1969:33](Source#cldf:ferrell1969)).  


The necessity of positing [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_SadiRi_ ‘house post’ leaves no alternative but to conclude that this type of residential structure has great antiquity among Austronesian-speaking peoples, and that the house types of the Atayal, Tsou, Paiwan, Rukai, Bunun, and Yami, which are constructed either directly on the ground, or in a shallow excavation, represent architectural innovations.  Such innovations may well have been motivated by a need to adjust to the colder conditions of life in the mountains, or by a need for protection from the seasonal typhoons that periodically sweep westward across the Pacific to southern Taiwan. 

Finally, accounts such as that of [Cunningham (1964)](Source#cldf:cunningham1964) and [Schulte Nordholt (1971:428ff)](Source#cldf:schultenordholt1971) make it clear that the dualistic cosmological symbolism embodied in the [Atoni](LanguageTable#cldf:231) house distinguishes ‘male’ and ‘female’ posts, associated respectively with the right and left sides.  Although the similar dualistic distinction in [Manam](LanguageTable#cldf:328) appears to be based on the length of the post itself rather than on its position within the larger domestic structure, it appears very likely from this linguistic symbolism that speakers of [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCEMP) made use of some type of dualistic symbolism which was expressed as a male/female contrast in certain of the supporting posts for the house.",PAN,Canonical

This word shows multiple irregular variations, making any reconstruction difficult. I have arbitrarily chosen to compare [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _sametsi_ with forms in other languages that are ambiguous for initial &ast;_S_ or zero.  



Finally, I am indebted to R. David Zorc for drawing my attention to the [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) and [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) forms, and for reminding me that he proposed an alternative reconstruction, &ast;_SamŭCi_, in [Zorc (1982:118)](Source#cldf:zorc1982).  Zorc’s motivation for positing an unstressed high back vowel in this form was to relate the otherwise unexplained high back vowels in [Maga Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:18979) _amicu_ (metathesis of &ast;i and &ast;u), Itbayaten humti (metathesis of &ast;a and &ast;u), Hanunóo untí (metathesis of &ast;_a_ and &ast;_u_), [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _moti_, and [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _muti_. 



The precarious nature of this reconstruction, however, should be obvious, since: it requires the assumption of 1) two different metathesis patterns in three different languages, 2) an irregular loss of &ast;_S-_ in [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) and [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) (this would be equally true if these forms were assigned to the present reconstruction), 3) syncope of an unstressed low vowel &ast;_a_ in [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) and [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273), and 4) an irregular loss of prepenultimate &ast;_a_ (rather than reduction to schwa) in [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819).  Moreover, it forces us to assume that the well-known syncope of schwa /VC__CV also applied to other vowels, including both &ast;_u_ and &ast;_a_.  I know of no evidence that might justify this assumption, which should be apparent in any of these languages that undergo rightward stress shift through suffixation (none of them shows a syncope pattern when this happens).  Add to this the fact that the initial consonants of the [Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), and [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) forms, the medial vowel of the [Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680), [Saaroa](LanguageTable#cldf:974) and [Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:397) forms, and the final consonant of the [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) form are unexplained by either reconstruction, and it appears clearly preferable  to settle on &ast;_SameCi_ and leave the rest of these apparently related but wildly irregular forms unexplained.",PAN,Canonical

In addition to their general verbal meanings, reflexes of [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PWMP) &ast;_hapit_ have two recurrent nominal senses: 1. the members of a wedding party who flank (‘squeeze in’) the bride or groom at the wedding ceremony, and 2. a part of the indigenous backstrap loom.  The distribution of forms with the former meaning is limited to two known languages ([Bahasa Indonesia](LanguageTable#cldf:240), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)), and probably is due to borrowing.

Judging from the glosses in [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) and [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), this structure extended across the lap of a seated weaver, and was bound at its ends by thongs which extended around her padded hips so as to control the desired tension on the warp threads.",PAN,Canonical

More exactly, what is chewed is the betel quid, a packet consisting of an outer leaf wrapping the nut and a small quantity of lime made by crushing the shells of marine molluscs or coral.

Dempwolff posited &ast;_imay_ ‘rice’, but based his reconstruction entirely on [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _eme_, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _imai_. 

Although [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_Semay_ apparently meant ‘cooked rice’, the meaning of [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) &ast;_hemay_ is less certain.  Both in northern Luzon and in [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) of northern Sulawesi, [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) &ast;_hemay_ is reflected in the meaning ‘rice in the field; unhusked rice’, and [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh) &ast;_ka-hemay-an_ ‘rice field’ supports a similar gloss for the unaffixed stem.  


At the same time, however, a number of languages in the central Philippines agree with [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) reflexes and with such variant forms in western Indonesia as [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _eme_ and [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _imai_ in supporting a gloss ‘cooked rice’.  In either case there are competing forms for the meaning in question.  

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_pajay_ clearly meant ‘rice in the field; unhusked rice’, and in this sense evidently persisted in [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:PPh).  Although reflexes of both &ast;_kaen-en_ and &ast;_nasi_ mean ‘cooked rice’ in widely separated languages, the former set of terms almost certainly developed this sense as a result of convergent change from an original meaning ‘what is eaten’, while some reflexes of the latter probably are borrowings of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _nasi_ ‘cooked rice’.",PAN,Canonical

This comparison is a noteworthy example of how fossilized morphology together with regular sound change can thoroughly disguise the connection of related forms, even when recurrent phonological correspondences have been established.

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_Simu_ evidently contains the element &ast;_-mu_ seen also in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_kamu_ ‘2p. pl.’.

Irregular reflexes of &ast;_Suab_ are quite common, particularly in the [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages.  The cognation of such [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) forms as [Seimat](LanguageTable#cldf:19050) _maw_ (where only -/w/ remains from the original stem) with  [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) forms such as [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _uab_ is clear from the fairly abundant intermediate forms that reflect [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_ma-Suab_ ( > _ma-huab_ > _ma-uab_ > _mawab_).  


A perfect parallel is seen in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_ma-Seyaq_, [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_mayaq_ ‘shy, ashamed’.  In both cases the boundary between the stative prefix &ast;_ma-_ and the stem has been lost in all [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CEMP) witnesses.  The only non-[CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CEMP) language in which a similar loss of morpheme boundary has taken place is [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) (with _magap_, for expected &ast;&ast;_magwap_ ‘yawn’).  Following the reanalysis of &ast;_ma-uab_ as &ast;_mawab_ a number of [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CEMP) languages have either introduced a new stative marker, or have reduplicated the first syllable of the new stem.  It remains unclear how many of these added syllables (if any) are the result of convergent developments.",PAN,Canonical
28294,younger sibling,dempwolff193438[],*Suaji,"Also [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _asé_ ‘younger sibling of the same sex’; friend’, [Nali](LanguageTable#cldf:878) _nali_ ‘sibling of the same sex’, [Lau](LanguageTable#cldf:313) _sāsi_ ( = _sa asiʔ_) ‘younger sibling of the same sex’.  [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed doublets &ast;_a(ŋ)ji_ ‘sibling, consanguine (generally younger)’ and &ast;_qa(ŋ)ji_ ‘sibling, consanguine (generally of the opposite sex)’.  The far richer evidence now available supports a trisyllabic etymon, but recurrent, mutually corroboratory irregularities leave open the possibility that we should reconstruct both &ast;_Suaji_ and &ast;_Saji_.  As evidence for the latter, disyllabic variant, we can cite [Proto-Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:19086) _&ast;agi_, [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) _agí_, [Balangaw](LanguageTable#cldf:509) _agí_, [Kallahan (Kayapa)](LanguageTable#cldf:676) _agí_, [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920) _agí_, [Sambal (Botolan)](LanguageTable#cldf:18976) _ali_, [Kalamian Tagbanwa](LanguageTable#cldf:18285) _ariʔ_, ATA _hari_, [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _hazi_, [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _ari_ and various forms in western Indonesia (some of which -- like [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _adé-k_ -- can regularly reflect either variant).  The presence of &ast;_-u-_ is, however, clearly supported by all [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) reflexes noted to date apart from [Proto-Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:19086) _&ast;agi_, by many reflexes in the northern Philippines, by [Tunjung](LanguageTable#cldf:1091) _gari-n_, by [Mentawai](LanguageTable#cldf:335) _bagi_, and by a number of reflexes in [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) languages.  



Because no [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) reflex is known to make us of a relative sex distinction, [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_Suaji_ must be reconstructed with the meaning ‘younger sibling’. However, agreement between at least [Manobo (Ata)](LanguageTable#cldf:818), [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427)  suggest that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_huaji_ meant ‘younger sibling of the same sex’.  It is clear that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) had four sibling terms: &ast;_betaw_ ‘sister’ (man speaking)’, &ast;_ñaRa_ ‘brother (woman speaking)’, &ast;_huaji_ and &ast;_kaka_.  Whether a relative sex distinction was or was not made in the terms &ast;_huaji_ and &ast;_kaka_, there can be no doubt that the former referred to younger and the latter to elder siblings.  In both [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) and Southern Toraja relative sex is used in the definition of cross-sibling terms, yet reflexes of &ast;_huaji_ and &ast;_kaka_ evidently apply to siblings of either sex regardless of sex of speaker. 



 It is possible that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) possessed a similar system, and that the more specific references to younger or elder siblings of the _same_ sex evolved independently in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) and [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CEMP) languages as a result of a tendency to divide up semantic space into mutually exclusive categories.  I find this scenario less convincing than the hypothesis that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_kaka_ and &ast;_huaji_ contained a relative sex component which became otiose and disappeared in those societies that lost descent groups (with which relative sex has an established positive correlation cross-culturally).  In addition to its literal sibling referents both [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_Suaji_ and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_huaji_ evidently referred to relatives in general, a fact noted as early as 1933 by F.A.E. van Wouden, who proposed an explanation for it ([van Wouden 1968 [1935]:120](bib-van)).  Finally, it appears likely from agreements in such widely scattered languages as [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) and [Gedaged](LanguageTable#cldf:269) that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_huaji_  could refer in certain contexts to the afterbirth or placenta (also cp.

The conch shell trumpet is well-known in the Pacific, where it played an important traditional role in the launching of voyaging canoes, the calling of members of the village to ceremonies, providing an alert to imminent danger, etc.  However, this reconstruction presents special problems, since its [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) status depends crucially on [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) (and the indirect support provided by the [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) evidence for the doublet &ast;_tabuRiq_).  In addition, a number of languages in the Philippines reflect a word with irregular &ast;_R_ > _l_, as with the [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) form just cited or similar forms in other languages of the Philippines (see Note to &ast;_tabuRiq_).  These appear to be loanwords, although the usual appeal to [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) as a source language does not work well here.  Given the limited set of forms that he compared, [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) erroneously reconstructed &ast;_tam-buri_ ‘triton shell trumpet’. It is now clear that the rhotic in this form was &ast;_R_, and that there is no comparative evidence for prenasalization of the medial stop.  Both of these observations were first made for [Proto-Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_tapuRi_ by [Ross (1988:147)](Source#cldf:ross1988). 



The limited pattern of survival of this form in both the Philippines and Indonesia suggests that it either disappeared among groups that moved inland to a montane environment where the conch was not easily obtained, or was replaced among lowlanders through contact-induced culture change.  All in all the pattern of distribution for reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_tabuRi_ (and its doublet form &ast;_tabuRiq_) suggests that survival was most strongly favored in areas of cultural conservatism, and disfavored where traditional practices either competed or conflicted with those introduced from outside, as among hispanized Filipinos, where the use of animal horns apparently came to be favored over shell trumpets, or among the peoples of western Indonesia, where overlays of Indian and Islamic cultural influence have altered many aspects of the traditional cultures of lowland groups.",PMP,Canonical

[Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) posited doublets &ast;_tanah_ and &ast;_tanəh_ ‘earth, land’, assigning [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _tana_ ‘rice field’ to the first of these, and _tanah_ ‘a land’ as in _tanah Jawa_ ‘the land of Java’ or _tanah belanda_ ‘Holland’ to the second.  However, the basis for this distinction is shaky.  [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _tana_ is a native term, while _tanah_ is clearly a borrowing of [Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243) _tanah_. Many languages have merged [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_a_ and &ast;_e_ before the reflex of word-final _&ast;q_, usually after it became a glottal stop.  It is the neutralization of this phonemic distinction before glottal stop that has given rise to the impression that there was a variant &ast;_tanaq_, which probably never existed.  
In addition to the subentries cited above the recurrent pattern of a reflex of &ast;_taneq_ + a place name suggests that the expression &ast;_taneq_ + place name existed in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) times.  


Finally, in some Oceanic languages, where final consonants have been lost, the reflexes of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_tanoq_ ‘earth, soil’ and &ast;_tanom_ ‘to plant, bury’ can be difficult to distinguish, and in fact are often combined by lexicographers or comparativists, as with [Keesing (1975)](Source#cldf:keesing1975), who gives [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307) _ano_ ‘land, ground’, a clear reflex of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_tanoq_, but the  subentry _anom-ia_ ‘plant, bury’, which is just as clearly a reflex of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_tanom_, or [Fox (1974)](Source#cldf:fox1974), who gives [Lau](LanguageTable#cldf:313) _ano_ ‘earth, land’, but the subentry _ano-mila_ ‘burying’, which exemplifies the same problem.  Similarly, [Bender et al (2003)](Source#cldf:benderetal2003) posit proto-Micronesian &ast;_tano_ ‘ground, low’, but refer additionally to e.g. [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _tano_ ‘place of burial, cemetery’, which clearly reflects [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_tanom_.",PMP,Canonical

Although the terms ‘year’ and ‘season’ occur in a number of the glosses cited here, it is clear that these must be connected more with the growing cycle of food plants and with greater or lesser rainfall than with vegetative changes in the natural environment of the kind associated with the seasons in temperate climates.

29990,to wait,tsuchida1976[232],*taRah,"[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_taRah_ ‘to wait’ is intriguing for several reasons. First, it is one of the few cognate sets which appears to provide evidence of homorganic nasal substitution in Formosan languages. Second, reflexes of &ast;_ma-naRah_ vs. &ast;_taRah_ are found even within the Atayalic group, distinguishing dialects of [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) from those of [Seediq](LanguageTable#cldf:407) ([Li 2004:688](bib-Li)), thus implying that &ast;_maŋ-_ was active in the relatively recent history of these languages, despite its general absence in Taiwan. Third, &ast;_taRah_ carries a variety of different affixes in all languages that reflect it, and it is very difficult to find examples of the simple base. Despite initial appearances, however, [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493), [Seediq](LanguageTable#cldf:407) and all known MP reflexes provide evidence for a doublet &ast;_naRa_, and it is the prefixation of this base that has given the false impression of homorganic nasal subsitution.

However, the data suggests a complex history of reanalysis that raises questions about the correctness of these reconstructions.  




The forms cited above point clearly to a trisyllable ending in _&ast;i_.  According to [Lanyon-Orgill (1962)](Source#cldf:lanyonorgill1962) Tolai (Raluana) _tarami_ is both a transitive and an intransitive verb.  It thus carries no morphological marking for transitivity.  However, most trisyllabic words in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) that ended with &ast;_-i_ would have been disyllabic bases with the transitive suffix &ast;_-i_.  In a monomorphemic base of this shape that was additionally a verb there would have been strong canonical pressure to reanalyze &ast;_taRamʷi_ as &ast;_taRamʷ-i_, and in languages that had already lost final consonants it is likely that this reanalysis would further treat the nasal as a thematic consonant, yielding an innovated base &ast;_taRa_.  This seems to have been what happened in e.g. [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359) _tala_ ‘to allow, permit; to agree, be willing; to nod in assent; to answer’, from a reanalyzed form &ast;_taRa(m)-i_, which then allowed the attachment of the applicative suffix &ast;_-aki_ to yield _tala(m)-agi_ ‘to agree to, make an agreement; to allow; to obey’.  A similar process evidently affected all Southeast Solomonic languages, as seen in [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307) _ala faafia_ ‘agree on’ (< _&ast;taRa_), _alamia_ ‘permit, allow’ (< &ast;_taRa(m)-ia_, or [Lau](LanguageTable#cldf:313) _ala-lā_ ‘an agreement’ (< &ast;_taRa_), _ala-mai_ ‘answer, obey, allow, take notice of’ (< &ast;_taRa_),  _alami_ ‘to answer, assent to; suit, fit, be worthy of’ (< &ast;_taRa(m)-i_.  By contrast, [Toqabaqita](LanguageTable#cldf:19197) _alamania_/_alamatania_ ‘allow someone to do something; let someone do something’, and  [Mota](LanguageTable#cldf:344) _taram_ ‘to suit, be becoming to, match’, _tarama_ ‘to answer a call’, _taramag_ ‘to answer another’ appear to reflect a base &ast;_taRama_, which may have arisen by back-formation from &ast;_taRa(m)-aki_, where the latter was interpreted as &ast;_taRama-aki_, with coalescence of two identical vowels.  




Without some such history of misanalyzed base forms and reinterpretation it would appear necessary to reconstruct doublets &ast;_taRama_ and &ast;_taRamʷi_ or &ast;_taRama_ and &ast;_taRa_, as Geraghty did, since there is no clear morphological precedent for analyzing the first of these forms as &ast;_taRa-ma_.",POC,Canonical

The central sense of this term evidently was ‘to shape wood by adzing’, and it presumably would have applied primarily to the shaping of timbers in house construction, and of tree trunks into the hulls of canoes.  Given its meaning it implies the use of adzes as distinct from axes, machetes, and knives, and therefore the existence of a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) term for ‘adze’ which is yet to be reconstructed.  Working with an adze involves a striking motion toward the actor, a semantic feature of this term that crops up in other senses, as in [Asilulu](LanguageTable#cldf:18016) _ta-tala_ ‘coconut rasp’, [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) _ara_ ‘to hoe’, or the [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) and [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390) forms that refer to scooping up sand or small fish.  In [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) and the Polynesian languages, on the other hand, the original sense of movement toward the actor in adzing wood evolved into a generalized notion of hitting, chopping, cutting, bailing water (by ‘striking’ at it with a paddle or bailer), or more abstractly, of killing.",PAN,Canonical

However, _derúdm_ suggests that &ast;_R_ > _r_ in [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) if the following syllable began with a dental consonant, even if the intervening vowel was not lost.  


The second noteworthy feature of this cognate set is its range of semantic reflexes.  Subgrouping considerations make it all but certain that the word referred originally to the puffer fish or porcupine fish, as this meaning is reflected both in [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) and in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages.  Among Austronesian speakers that became reoriented to a primarily inland environment the meaning was shifted to cover other roundish, spiny biota (porcupine, durian).  A parallel semantic extension is seen in [Pohnpeian](LanguageTable#cldf:381) _sei_, where the reference to the soursop could hardly be original, as the plant is said to be a native of tropical America ([Merrill 1954:152](Source#cldf:merrill1954)).

While a reflex of &ast;_tiaN_ refers to the upper abdomen in both [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) and [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062), and probably had a similar sense in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN), a corresponding term for ‘lower abdomen’ has not yet been reconstructed.  [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396) and [Eddystone/Mandegusu](LanguageTable#cldf:261) regularly preserve final consonants through the addition of an echo vowel, and in body-part terms that ended in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_n_ this gave rise to an ambiguity as to whether the final syllable _–na_ was part of the base or was the 3rd person singular possessive suffix, which was required with such nouns.

This comparison raises a number of questions.  The first reaction of many would be to dismiss it as a loanword that probably postdates Indian cultural contact beginning around 2,000 BP.  There is no question that many or all of the forms cited in this note and probably some cited in the above comparison are loanwords, but the entire set cannot be dismissed, as in many cases the sound correspondences are regular and fairly complex.  If the entire set of forms is a product of borrowing then it is necessary to identify a source language, and in most widely-attested loan distributions in island Southeast Asia this is [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326).

[Dempwolff](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed a version of this term with the meaning ‘old’, but the semantics of &ast;_tuqaS_ and its derivative &ast;_ma-tuqaS_ appear far more complex than this.

However, [Muna](LanguageTable#cldf:350) _ka-tugha_ means ‘forest, jungle’, the gloss for [Asilulu](LanguageTable#cldf:18016) _matua_ includes ‘very old, of huge trees’, and that for [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) _matua_ includes ‘(of bush, forest) be dense, thick’.

The relationship of these forms to [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _tsudjuq-an_ ‘a finger’ is unclear, as the latter supports &ast;_Cuzuq_, while all other diagnostic Formosan witnesses instead indiate &ast;_tuzuq_. In some cases the apparent support for &ast;_t-_ rather than &ast;_C-_ may be due to unrecognized narrow conditions, as in [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386), which evidently does not permit dissimilar retroflex stops within the same morpheme, and dissimilates the first of these to its alveolar counerpart.  However, a similar appeal to conditioning appears to be more difficult for [Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) and [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062). 



As [Wilkinson (1959:1242)](Source#cldf:wilkinson1959) has noted for [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), the association of the innovative word for ‘seven’ with the index finger derives from a system of finger-counting in which the thumb moves from little finger to index finger and then reverses direction, encountering the index finger for the second time after the thumb has served for both ‘five’ and ‘six’. Reflexes of &ast;_tuzuq_ in the indisputably innovative meaning ‘seven’ are of some interest for the internal subgrouping of WMP languages, as they include the languages of Sabah and Sarawak (but not of southeastern Borneo), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and its closest relatives, the Chamic languages and [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) (but not [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285)). However, many of the languages of Sabah also share an indisputably innovative word for ‘nine’ (reflecting &ast;_siam_) with most of the languages of the Philippines. Since at least one of these lexical innovations must have acquired its attested distribution in part by diffusion the potential subgrouping value of &ast;_tuzuq_ in the meaning ‘seven’ is somewhat compromised.",PAN,Canonical

The number of instances of &ast;_h_ in this form is somewhat unclear. [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244), [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819)  and [Tausug](LanguageTable#cldf:18831)  appear to reflect &ast;_h-_, but Bisayan reflexes (which show epenthetic vowels inserted after the regular syncope of shwa) suggest that these forms may involve metathesis of earlier &ast;_urhí_ (> _hurí_).  The presence of _final_ /_h_/ is suggested by suffixed forms in [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226),  but is contradicted by [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) and [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252).



The most interesting feature of this form undoubtedly is its meaning, which cannot be captured by any single, readily available semantic category of English. Perhaps the most basic and concrete sense of &ast;_udehi_ and its derivatives is ‘behind, coming after or later; be last’.  In this sense it (like the demonstrative pronouns &ast;_-Cu_, &ast;_-na_, &ast;_-ni_, etc.) has both a spatial and a temporal reference.  



In its temporal sense &ast;_udehi_ referred not only to posteriority in sequence, but to future time in general (cf. [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _kemudian hari_, and semantically similar reflexes in [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124), [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414), [Kei](LanguageTable#cldf:298), [Tuvaluan](LanguageTable#cldf:19417)  and [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330)).  This usage is striking, since the spatial imagery of the future in Indo-European languages typically places it _before,_ not behind the observer. 



Two other concrete senses of &ast;_udehi_ that are widely reflected are ‘stern/rudder of a boat’ (reflexes in [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678), various languages of western Melanesia, and [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620)), and ‘youngest child’ ( = ‘one who comes last’, with reflexes in [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647), [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678), [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395), [Yamdena](LanguageTable#cldf:1130)  and [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330)).  



A number of other meanings appear to be confined to [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CEMP)  languages, and it is assumed that these are semantic innovations rather than retentions that have been lost in all non-[CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CEMP)  languages.  These include: 1. the meaning ‘west’, attested in [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) of the Lesser Sundas, and in such Polynesian languages as [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390) and [Anuta](LanguageTable#cldf:229), 2. ‘young’, reflected in [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395), [Selaru](LanguageTable#cldf:409), [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434), [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362), [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401)  and [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620), 3. ‘outside’, reflected in [Yamdena](LanguageTable#cldf:1130), [Fordata](LanguageTable#cldf:18184), [Gedaged](LanguageTable#cldf:269), [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359)  and [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485), and 4. ‘heel’, reflected in [Lau](LanguageTable#cldf:313), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390)  and [Kapingamarangi](LanguageTable#cldf:292).  Of these four innovative meanings the last appears to have arisen in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC)  or some descendant thereof.  Although it is not attested in strictly cognate forms, it appears safe to infer that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:POC) &ast;_m-uri qaqe_, &ast;_m-uri waqe_ meant ‘heel’.  The second semantic innovation evidently is an extension of the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) sense ‘youngest child’, and requires no further comment.  The last two innovated meanings are best treated together, as they appear to reflect a broader symbolism of directionality.  



Terms for the cardinal directions cannot be reconstructed for any early Austronesian proto-language, but the symbolic association of &ast;_udehi_ with the west is understandable through the sense ‘later; the future’.  In many Austronesian-speaking societies (and, indeed, many traditional societies in general) the east is associated with life and the west with death, a transparent symbolism deriving from the daily course of the sun.  If [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_ma-udehi_ was used in the sense of ‘west’ it seems likely that this usage was figurative or symbolic (in some ritual sense) rather than literal, given the other, more basic senses of the term.  The cultural context of such symbolism remains unclear.  



Finally, the semantic evolution from ‘behind, later’ to ‘outside’ in a number of languages is puzzling, and can be compared to the development &ast;_babaw_ ‘above’ to ‘outside’ in other languages.  Paths of semantic change such as these suggest that the underlying system of spatial relations in Austronesian languages is fundamentally different from that in Indo-European languages, even though one-to-one category matches such as &ast;_babaw_ = ‘above’ can easily be made (cf. [Blust (1997)](Source#cldf:blust1997)).",PMP,Canonical

In some communities it is possible that a word still exists for this referent, but due to the influence of major world religions (Islam, Christianity) there is a reluctance to acknowledge that such a cultural practice once existed, or even to speak about it. Some Bornean reflexes suggest that &ast;_uduq_ referred both to a carved wooden figure set up outside a village to ensure supernatural protection, and to a ceremonial dance mask, but this is not confirmed by any witness outside Borneo.  In addition, all known reflexes in Borneo show a lowered last-syllable vowel which is irregular, and may reflect a pattern of borrowing.

The basic sense of this term appears to have been ‘return (X) to its former place or condition’.  More specific glosses include ‘return home’, ‘return something to someone’ and  ‘restore, repair’.  Either singly or reduplicated &ast;_uliq_ also conveyed the notion of repetition (reflexes in [Itawis](LanguageTable#cldf:648), [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920), [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273), [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Tolai](LanguageTable#cldf:19416), [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359)), or of motion to and fro ([Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325), [Yamdena](LanguageTable#cldf:1130), [Rarotongan](LanguageTable#cldf:388)).

28642,verbal infix marking actor voice,schmidt1906[],*<um>,"&ast;_-um-_ is, along with &ast;_-in-_, one of the two commonest infixes in Austronesian, and was a cornerstone in [Schmidt's (1906)](Source#cldf:schmidt1906) Austric hypothesis, since an infix of partially similar shape is found in various Austroasiatic languages. Although no clear reflex is known in [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CEMP), reflexes of &ast;_-um-_ are widely distributed in [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) and [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages.  The syntax and semantics of these reflexes differs significantly across languages, in some cases across closely related languages (e.g. [Hiligaynon](LanguageTable#cldf:623), where _-um-_ is described as ""a verbal affix designating completed action"", and [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), where _-um-_ marks the actor focus of certain transitive verbs, intransitive verbs that refer to natural actions in topicless sentences, and inchoatives).  


These differences of meaning are most sharply marked by the boundary between [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:Form.) and [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages.  In the former reflexes of &ast;_-um-_ mark actor focus with no widely-shared semantic restrictions defining verb classes, and no competition with other affixes marking the same syntactic relations.  In [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) languages, on the other hand, reflexes of &ast;_-um-_ compete with reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_maŋ-_, and to some extent &ast;_maR-_ as markers of actor focus relationships.  As a result there are restrictions on the type of verb to which a reflex of &ast;_-um-_ may attach, and some of these are widely shared within [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP).

This form evidently referred to the ordinary honeybee as opposed to the smaller _Apis indica_ (&ast;_qari-ñuan_, &ast;_qani-Ruan_), or the stingless _Trigona_ spp., and in this function it replaced [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_waNu_ ‘honeybee’.",PMP,Canonical

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) &ast;_ka-_ may have distinguished right/left hand from right/left side/direction, but the function of this minimally productive affix remains unclear.

28761,canoe,dempwolff193438[];doran1981[],*waŋka,"Based on the comparison [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _waŋkaŋ_ ‘ship’, [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _waŋkaŋ_ ‘Chinese junk’, [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _waŋga_ ‘canoe’, [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434), [Futunan](LanguageTable#cldf:607) _vaka_, [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) _vaʔa_ ‘canoe’ [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_waŋkaŋ_ ‘water vehicle, ship, canoe’.  This long accepted etymology actually is highly problematic.  


First, reflexes with a final nasal are known in only five languages, and in each case these refer specifically to Chinese junks: [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _waŋkaŋ_ ‘Chinese junk’, _tanah waŋkaŋ_ ‘China’; [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _waŋkaŋ_ ‘Chinese ocean-going junk’, _limau waŋkaŋ_ ‘imported Chinese oranges’; [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) _waŋkaŋ_ ‘Chinese junk (boat)’.  


Second, neither the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) nor the [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) words can regularly reflect &ast;_waŋkaŋ_, since &ast;_w-_ disappeared in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and &ast;_wa-_ became [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _o_.  


Moreover, the word in [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), which is spoken in the interior river systems of Southeast Borneo, clearly is a loan from the coastal [Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243).  It appears likely, then, that _waŋkaŋ_ is a loan from some southern form of Chinese (Fukienese?  Hakka?)  which was borrowed into [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285).


In apparent contradiction to this conclusion are reflexes in [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP), [South Halmahera-West New Guinea](LanguageTable#cldf:SHWNG), and especially [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages, where the probability of early borrowing from Chinese is all but non-existent.  Since most [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) languages have lost original final consonants, many [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) reflexes could derive from &ast;_waŋkaŋ_.  In those languages which normally preserve the final consonant, however, no final consonant is found in this word ([Dobuan](LanguageTable#cldf:258), [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396)), thus supporting &ast;_waŋka_, not &ast;_waŋkaŋ_. [Doran (1981)](Source#cldf:doran1981) has chosen this form as the title of a book on Austronesian canoe origins, but he combines a genuine [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:OC) cognate set with such non-cognate [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:WMP) forms as [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _baŋkaʔ_ ‘boat’, [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _lakana_ (Prov. _laka_) ‘canoe’. 


 It is now simplest to conclude that &ast;_waŋka_ was an innovation which appeared in northeastern Indonesia prior to the separation of the [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) and [EMP](LanguageTable#cldf:EMP) language groups from one another, but after the separation of [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PCEMP) from all other Austronesian languages.  Under this interpretation, the similarity of the native term &ast;_waŋka_ to the apparent loanword _waŋkaŋ_ must be considered a remarkable coincidence.  Under this interpretation, [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _waŋga_ (for expected &ast;&ast;_waŋka_) ‘boat’ is best regarded as a loan from some still undetermined [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:CMP) source.",PCEMP,Canonical

As noted in [Blust (1985)](Source#cldf:blust1985) the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) generic term for ‘vine’ contradicts certain proposed universal evolutionary sequences in [Brown (1984)](Source#cldf:brown1984).  In private correspondence Brown has maintained that &ast;_waRej_ probably meant ‘tying material’.  There is, however, no empirical basis for Brown's conclusion.  [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_waRej_ clearly contrasts with [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_talih_ ‘rope, string, cordage’, and the semantic contrast is maintained in some attested languages, as [Nauna](LanguageTable#cldf:355) (Admiralties), where _way_ means either ‘vine’ or ‘rope’, but _tɨl_ (< &ast;_talih_) means only ‘rope’ (never ‘vine’).  


The semantic extensions to ‘rope’, ‘snake’ ([PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_nipay_) and ‘vein, tendon’ ([PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:PMP) &ast;_uRat_) are all easily understood as modifications of an original meaning ‘vine’. Examples of the transfer of a term for a raw material to some useful product made from it are cited in [Blust (1985)](Source#cldf:blust1985).  The English word ‘rope’ is not only applied to vines, but is extended to veins and tendons in New Guinea Pidgin, and in Borneo and Sumatra the word for ‘vine’ is often used as a benign substitute for ‘snake’ when one is exposed to the danger of snakes in the jungle.  Significantly, reflexes of &ast;_talih_ rarely mean ‘vine’, and never mean ‘snake’.",PMP,Canonical

30908,millet sp.: Setaria italica (?),buck1949[513],*zawa₂,"[Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _jawa_, after which the island of Java may have been named, is sometimes thought to be a loan from Sanskrit _yawa_ ‘barley’, a word that reportedly derives from the more general term ‘grain’ attested in both Avestan and Sanskrit ([Buck 1949: 513](Source#cldf:buck1949)).  Adopting this interpretation requires the assumption that Sanskrit _yawa_ ‘barley’ was borrowed as pre-Javanese _jawa_ ‘millet’ within the past two millennia, as the early Indian name for Java was Yawadwipa, presumably because millet was widely cultivated on Java at that time (barley is not a native Southeast Asian crop --- see the doubts expressed in the gloss of Old Javanese jawa).  


This putative loanword then spread northward with substitution of _d_ for _j_ in languages that lacked palatals, presumably replacing whatever term applied to the type of millet that this word represented.  One possible scenario, then, is that _jawa_ > _dawa_ replaced reflexes of &ast;_beCeŋ_ ‘foxtail millet: _Setaria italica_’.  However, the specific application of reflexes of &ast;_zawa_ to foxtail millet in southern Taiwan and much of the central Philippines (but not in intervening areas) argues against this interpretation and in favor of &ast;_zawa_ as a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:PAN) term that has been lost over wide areas but retained in scattered pockets in its original meaning.  Various references ([Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226), [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252), [Agutaynen](LanguageTable#cldf:19189), [Yakan](LanguageTable#cldf:1129), [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276)) suggest that millet was secondary to rice as a daily staple in virtually all language groups, a factor that may have played a role in the far more robust attestation for terms like &ast;_pajay_ or &ast;_beRas_ as compared with &ast;_beCeŋ_, or &ast;_zawa_.",PAN,Canonical
